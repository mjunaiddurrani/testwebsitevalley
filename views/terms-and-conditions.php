        SECTION 5 – REFUND POLICY
    </h4>
    <div class="info">
        In any occasion, any funds deposited will not be liable for a refund if the initial design and concepts (after delivery) are approved. All requests for refund will be as per the following arrangement:
        <br><br>
        The client makes a solicitation where the underlying ideas for a logo are provided. However once the client approves or asks for changes in the initial designs, the refund offer will be void and a request for refund will not be approved.
        <br><br>
        Once the project enters the revision phase, the refund offer will be void and a request for refund will not be approved.
        <br><br>
        A refund request should have a legitimate reason which must be qualified against the outline brief and client input for revisions. Unless an idea has not been composed as per the brief, a refund will not be approved.
    </div>
    <h5 class="h5 mt-4">
        5.1: Refund on Logo Packages

        <br><br>
        If the refund request is made within 5 business days after the Initial Website Mockup, you will only be eligible for a 66% refund (excluding 10% administration and preparing expense).

        <br><br>
        Money Back Guarantee depends on that the request is set in accordance with some basic honesty. Where a client has placed design orders with more than one agency for the same job, with the intention of claiming a refund, Proficient Webdesigns does not consider this to be in good faith. In such instances, we reserve the right to decline a refund request.
        <br><br>
        All design jobs require client input before finishing the design which is why the customer must be active throughout the process and gives feedback in order to get the required results.
        <br><br>
        100% unique design guarantee qualifies you for a new logo if the logo designed by Proficient Webdesigns is found to be considerably similar to another design that already exists. Any likeness to a current outline will be considered a fortuitous event and Proficient Webdesigns will not acknowledge any responsibility or claim of any compensation in such a case. It is the client’s responsibility to get their artwork copyrighted.
        <br><br>
        *All refund requests should be properly documented &amp; must be communicated through the channels mentioned in Section 6 with the reason for discontent. You agree to a 10% processing fee deduction from the order amount when the refund is processed. Refunds are issued within 8 to 10 business days from the day that the cancellation was requested. You agree that your acceptance of the refund shall constitute your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to related Responses. Additionally, you acknowledge that you will have no right (express or implied) to use any Response or other work product, content, or media, nor will you have any ownership interest in or to the same. All sections of this Agreement which, by their nature, shall survive termination, shall survive including payment, indemnity and the disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability.
