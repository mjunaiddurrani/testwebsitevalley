                                                We get asked for a lot of different types of game design and development services these days. Some need programming help; some need design help; other times they just require a digital assistant who could develop gaming assets. Today’s case is different as we share about simple yet interesting gaming clients. We were excited about the idea of working on a game, but during the engagement process, our new client asked us to work on the idea from the scratch. This is where we realized there could be additional value in working together. We ended up creating an app that has been successful in gathering overwhelming responses from the players.

However, there was a twist to it, in order to beat the score of your opponent, you have to jump the color and react on a whim when shown which color needs to be jumped. Due to the simplicity of the project and its 2D designing nature, we used Adobe Photoshop for drawing the initial sketch of the game while using Unity, C#, and Lua as our leading app development software. Once the game was developed, we did beta testing to ensure everything was up to the mark and lived up to both clients' and the gamers' expectations.  </p>

                                        We were working on a project for a small client. Therefore, they did not have a high budget, to begin with. To make sure we deliver a quality app under a reasonable budget, we had to come up with the game that did not cost a lot of resources on our end. Since the client wasn't sure how they wanted their game to look or what particular features they wanted to be included in the game, they gave us the liberty to figure it out ourselves. We had to do all the research ourselves and develop a game from scratch, it became a challenging part of the project. In addition, the client wanted us to create a game that would be free and accessible to everyone using an Android phone.

                                        We spent several hours playing around games that were simple and involved colors coding and switching during the ideation time. This game wasn't exactly supposed to be a puzzle. Therefore, we wanted to make sure we did our research about color-coding games. From the beginning of the project, we wanted to explore and develop a different game that was not only addictive but retained the players. We did extensive research and did brainstorming sessions with our fellow team members till we came up with the idea of a color jumper. Despite the game's minimalism, we managed to include difficulty levels in the game as the gamer goes to higher levels.

                                        The game consists of 3 different levels (easy, medium, and hard). Each level offers a different approach to the same problem and how it can be solved. All levels offer high-quality background music, simple graphics, and a unique gaming experience all together brought by the great hints system to ensure players won't feel left behind and will enjoy playing the game. The sound effects and the exciting color jumping experience make the game amusing and attractive.

                                            Let’s Talk About Our UI/UX Design Strategy.

                                        Using our expertise and knowledge, we developed a unique, millennial-friendly game that was enlightening, entertaining, and fun to play. Since the game features are innovative and inspiring, the game was created using cutting-edge technology. We used 2D pixel art objects and animations, each one having its personality. Furthermore, it has a different level of difficulty, starting from easy to challenging, that can be changed by the player or depending on the settings selected, which made the game interesting for the players. As mentioned earlier, the UI/UX designs were minimalistic. Therefore, there was not much complex coding involved. However, the designers used color psychology to keep the players on their toes.

                                        After the client approved the game's design, it then went to the development phase. In this phase, the rules of the games were set. The blocks had a pattern to follow. However, it was a random pattern, so that the player had to move it around to strategically remove obstructions from the screen. All this was done using Lua, C#, JavaScript, and Unity as the primary tool to develop this game

                                        <p class="font-size-18 lh-16 pr-3 ">
                                            In lieu of the traditional color jumping game development apps, the team took a different approach by developing a prototype first. The prototype had all the essential features required to create a realistic game. This helped us on several fronts, one of which was by focusing on a detailed analysis of the gameplay mechanics. It also helps us decide what features should or shouldn't be prioritized during development or integrated into the base code more efficiently.

                                        Our beta testing teams, and researchers tested the game numerous times. This ensured that the game does not have any glitches or bugs that will cause difficulties to the player's experience of the game. The beta testers were also able to give us feedback on the game's features, artistry, immersion factor of the game, etc. We then further adjusted these features accordingly before finalizing them for launch.

                                        It was a fascinating project to work on, and we were trying to develop something that users would like. Most importantly, we were trying to create a game that the players could comfortably play in their free time without accessing the internet. While realizing the target audience's need, we made sure we fulfilled their expectations and gave them something fun and interactive. This resulted in a very successful launch, and we hope to continue receiving positive feedback from the client and the game players.
