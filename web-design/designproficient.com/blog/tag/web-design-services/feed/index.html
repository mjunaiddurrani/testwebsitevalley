				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently, this is not a normal time in which the whole world is suffering. COVID-19 (Coronavirus) has erupted in millions of people worldwide. Many people have lost their families and increasingly try to feed themselves and their families. For many of us, the future is uncertain. If we have learned something in the past few months, mutual support is the best part of the web design industry.</p>
<h3>Letâs Talk About Web Design Industry</h3>
<p>As the novel coronavirus carries on to spread globally, the website development or design companies and freelancers must be aware of its impact on business and organize accordingly. Coronavirus pandemics are a threat to freelancers and <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">web design companies</a> and their employees, not only from a well-being perception but also from an economic perspective. With the global economy in a difficult time, more and more people are limited to working from home.</p>
<p>The current state of COVID-19 has had a significant economic impact on the business and technology sectors of the public and private sectors. Not only in certain areas in about 100 countries but also personal life.</p>
<p>The official report confirmed that, as in other sectors, the impact on the economy is expected to dropping to -13%, contracting 1.7% next year, and slowing growth in the first two quarters of this year.</p>
<h3>Significant Impact on Supply Chain</h3>
<p>With rapid growth, now is the right time for technology and web development companies to reduce risk and design solutions. The virus caused delays in some essential meetings related to large-scale technology and web development that had a significant impact on business. As the number of confirmed cases worldwide increases, the results will be much more complicated than expected. There is no doubt that people are trying to work at their location, but due to delays in planning and collaboration opportunities, they are still unable to provide accurate results.</p>
<h3>Impact on Productivity and Performance</h3>
<p>In general, the virus has a significant impact on employee productivity and performance, because it is challenging to adjust targets for bonuses, sales, and coincidences when employees are working from home. Daily productivity and performance manipulation are key issues. The most severe loss is for SMEs, who cannot use telework spaces properly. As a result, the company has renounced these employees and reduced salaries. This also has a major impact on the entire business and production.</p>
<h3>How to Cope With This Pandemic:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Website designers need to figure out a way to curtail costs. Consider meeting with new or existing customers on the internet to reduce travel costs and gas charges.</li>
<li>Since web designers and developers have fewer clients these days due to coronavirus threats, they can invest their free time to learn new skills and increasing their knowledge.</li>
<li>Digital platforms working with famous brands are less vulnerable to small and medium-sized businesses. Working with these platforms is an excellent way to increase corporate leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>&#8220;We all suffering from this pandemic, so stay safe, everyone, stay home&#8221;</strong></em></p>

Photoshop costs Â£20 a month while Adobe CC kit costs around Â£45 a month. If you are using one of the apps from Adobe kit, each might cost you somewhere around Â£20. There even are paid invoice generating software which you might need to use.</p>
<h2><strong>Taxation and Licensing </strong></h2>
<p><strong>Â </strong></p>
<p>If you work in an office or even as a freelancer in a country where your income is taxed then you must include the taxation in the invoice to get your expense recovered. Licensing of your work is based on the media in which your artwork will be used by the client. For example if you are designing a billboard or a print ad, it is going to be charged high than a flyer, brochure, visiting card or a social media creative. Similarly, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">website designing</a> also has a different schedule of cost.</p>

<p><strong>Â </strong></p>
<p><strong>Â 1. Gradients.</strong></p>
<p>Even though advancements in design technologies has allowed the use of gradients to be easily accessible to all designers, its proper use is still considered a difficult art to master. However, the advantages of the impact gradients have on the overall look of a design are undoubtedly noticeable. Listed below are some of the types of gradients that are being used thoroughly by successful designers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal, linear gradient.</li>
<li>Radial gradient.</li>
<li>Diagonal gradient.</li>
<li>Vertical linear fade.</li>
<li>Vertical gradient.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very important to maintain a subtle visual flow at all times when using gradients. This always compliments the overall integrity of the design and helps the rest of the design elements to gel perfectly together.</p>
<p><strong>2. Kerning.</strong></p>
<p>Kerning or letter spacing is a very important skill to be mastered. The perfect letter spacing makes or breaks any kind of design. It plays a very important role in headlines, logos, paragraphs or anything that has text. Itâs amazing to notice the impact letter spacing has on a logo design and designers across the globe have started to emphasize significantly more on mastering the skill of perfectly spacing letters in any kind of design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Upper and Lower Casing.</strong></p>
<p>Itâs hard to imagine the impact a simple technique like the use of upper or lower case has on a design and yet some amateur designers completely overlook the importance of casing. Typography is completely dependent on the right use of the upper or lower case. Itâs what makes or breaks a design, and if the designers have a knack for using the right case then their designs always stand out from the rest.</p>

<h1>Grid Free Designing</h1>
<p>Most designers are taught to follow a system of grids for designing to generate alignment and a proper structure. Have you ever thought of designing without grids? Many designers will say NO to this question.</p>
<p>The grid system actually bounds you into a confined structure that never let you to be creative. Grid-free designing is now getting popularity because customized designs can be generated with full freedom.</p>
<h2>Mixing Horizontal and vertical sliding</h2>
<p>Usually, the whole structure of the<a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/blog/45-horizontal-websites-showcase/"> website is vertical or horizontal.</a> The slides of images either go right to left or move up &amp; down. Playing with both x and y-axis at a time can also be a great idea. Though the execution of the design is a little bit difficult but a true artist knows how to handle that all.</p>
<p>It can be highly creative and attractive for fashionable products that some stuff is moving horizontally while some is moving up and down.</p>
<h2>Bright Colors</h2>
<p>Many times designers are afraid of using bright colors because they believe that sharp colors will give a harsh look to their design and the design may look cheap as well. Their thoughts are right to some extend but this issue can be catered by making hash colors complementing with other colors. Use of bright colors along with soft palettes can soothe the sharp effect of any color. You can also play with shades and tones to generate an appealing look of your design.</p>
<h2>Layout of Photos</h2>
<p>Usually designers layout their images into some patterns. This looks really organized and synchronized. But what if you place them without any layout. They will still look great and can spark up your design. Unorganized images can allow the human eye to stay more to figure out what is actually going within the design. They keep the curiosity factor alive in a design.</p>
<p>You can try these hacks for mockups or practice designing. The best way to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">explore new techniques</a> is to design and ask other people to rate your work. This can be great fun. You can understand the small clinches that become hindrances between you and creativity.</p>

Especially as it is extremely important in the era of online social existence. Nowadays new websites are emerging with the same services but with a new reliable design, this includes user-friendly navigation, fresh contents, speed and functionality.

<ul>
<li><strong>Color Combination or Shades</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Color harmony is one of the most integral part of a website design. <a href="https://designproficient.com/web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Every website designer uses a specific color that describes the companyâs profile</a>. E.g. Facebook uses blue color and Lipton tea uses yellow color to represent their website and customer loyalty. Choose the color wisely as it can affect the next-time visit of the audience.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layout</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Layout is the structure of your website. That basically deals on how you arrange the contents and how the text and pictures are aligned. Visitors focus on the content of website at first in order to keep their attention, this is important that how will you choose to display homepage and menus. If you display menus in the same place in every pages, this will keep the visitors stay focused on the contents. Keep in mind that simplicity makes it beautiful.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coding Language</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding to build a website, the first thing that should be considered is coding language for your website. You have to know the strengths and limitations of these languages. It is essential because some languages are not supported by some browsers which will irritate or limit a visitor from viewing your website.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile responsive design</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The rate of browsing from smart phone is much greater than the rate of browsing a website from you laptop or PC because people tend to keep themselves updated and spend almost 70% percent of their time on mobile devices. Here you have to focus on features like smoothness, GPS, and mobility that keeps visitor feel comfortable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft Animation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For capturing the visitorâs attention, visual effects and animation is the key. Many website uses soft animation by sliding their project photos, which replaces a large summary of content by standard photos displayed animatedly. Keep those animations that are responsive and draws attention. But overloaded animation will frustrate the visitor.</p>
<p>Time to wrap up, either you have built your website or it is already built. Itâs the time to consider the above 5 trends that are part of todayâs social media competition. In order to survive socially, you have to follow and adjust according to the need of visitors.
