<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> 1. Gradients.</strong></p>
<p>Even though advancements in design technologies has allowed the use of gradients to be easily accessible to all designers, its proper use is still considered a difficult art to master. However, the advantages of the impact gradients have on the overall look of a design are undoubtedly noticeable. Listed below are some of the types of gradients that are being used thoroughly by successful designers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal, linear gradient.</li>
<li>Radial gradient.</li>
<li>Diagonal gradient.</li>
<li>Vertical linear fade.</li>
<li>Vertical gradient.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very important to maintain a subtle visual flow at all times when using gradients. This always compliments the overall integrity of the design and helps the rest of the design elements to gel perfectly together.</p>
<p><strong>2. Kerning.</strong></p>
<p>Kerning or letter spacing is a very important skill to be mastered. The perfect letter spacing makes or breaks any kind of design. It plays a very important role in headlines, logos, paragraphs or anything that has text. It’s amazing to notice the impact letter spacing has on a logo design and designers across the globe have started to emphasize significantly more on mastering the skill of perfectly spacing letters in any kind of design.</p>

Typography is completely dependent on the right use of the upper or lower case. It’s what makes or breaks a design, and if the designers have a knack for using the right case then their designs always stand out from the rest.</p>

<h1>Grid Free Designing</h1>
<p>Most designers are taught to follow a system of grids for designing to generate alignment and a proper structure. Have you ever thought of designing without grids? Many designers will say NO to this question.</p>
<p>The grid system actually bounds you into a confined structure that never let you to be creative. Grid-free designing is now getting popularity because customized designs can be generated with full freedom.</p>
<h2>Mixing Horizontal and vertical sliding</h2>
<p>Usually, the whole structure of the<a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/blog/45-horizontal-websites-showcase/"> website is vertical or horizontal.</a> The slides of images either go right to left or move up &amp; down. Playing with both x and y-axis at a time can also be a great idea. Though the execution of the design is a little bit difficult but a true artist knows how to handle that all.</p>
<p>It can be highly creative and attractive for fashionable products that some stuff is moving horizontally while some is moving up and down.</p>
<h2>Bright Colors</h2>
<p>Many times designers are afraid of using bright colors because they believe that sharp colors will give a harsh look to their design and the design may look cheap as well. Their thoughts are right to some extend but this issue can be catered by making hash colors complementing with other colors. Use of bright colors along with soft palettes can soothe the sharp effect of any color. You can also play with shades and tones to generate an appealing look of your design.</p>
<h2>Layout of Photos</h2>
<p>Usually designers layout their images into some patterns. This looks really organized and synchronized. But what if you place them without any layout. They will still look great and can spark up your design. Unorganized images can allow the human eye to stay more to figure out what is actually going within the design. They keep the curiosity factor alive in a design.</p>
<p>You can try these hacks for mockups or practice designing. The best way to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">explore new techniques</a> is to design and ask other people to rate your work. This can be great fun. You can understand the small clinches that become hindrances between you and creativity.</p>
