<p>Writing content is very easy for those who have a passion for writing or are just good with spinning the words. However, writing content for search engine optimization asks for a little more. There are certain things that a writer should keep in his mind while writing content for SEO purpose.</p>

<p>Let us discuss a few below!</p>
<p><strong>Keep your page load low</strong> – According to famous digital marketer and SEO expert, Neil Patel says that 40% of the people withdraw themselves from surfing on a page that takes more than 3 seconds to load. Make sure you craft the pages keeping these stats in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Make powerful and meaningful headlines</strong> – Headlines play an important role for SEO content. First of all your content must include headlines and these headlines should be in correct length and include relevant keywords in them.</p>
<p><strong>Make use of correct CTAs (Call to action)</strong> – <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/scannable-content/">SEO content must have a few lines that can drive the reader for an action</a>. You can do this by using words like “click, share or comment” at the end of your SEO blog or article.</p>
<p><strong>Address the reader</strong> – The sign of a good content is where the addressee is defined. The reader should be addressed directly throughout the content. This makes your content more engaging and optimizes its readability.</p>
<p><strong>Use of keywords</strong> – A well written content is the one which is backed by intelligent keyword research. A writer should know how to incorporate the picked keywords in their articles and follow the ratio in the content accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid using jargons</strong> – Jargons should not be used in great volume in a content. Try to go easy with words that can conveniently be understood by the readers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a single person living in this digital era can say ‘NO’ to the importance of Marketing. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">Marketing is compulsory for any business</a>. It is something through which you can make your product well-known in the eyes of the people. Not limited to this, the industry is developing on each successive day. Marketing can be referred as a breeding ground that has opened many doors of success not only for business but also for many folks. But, unfortunately, like many industries, this industry also become a prey of irrelevant myths. So, let’s check out some of the important myths of marketing:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/08/simple-introduction-custom-web-design/">A Simple Introduction To Custom Web Design</a></p>
<p>Myth #1: <strong>Customers Take Your Social Posts for granted</strong></p>
<p>It is not true. Customers read your social content and it also can convince and influence their purchasing decisions. The study reveals, “Nearly 70% of B2C companies and 40% of B2B companies have developed their customer base through social networking sites.” It doesn’t matter much what the social network is, any text, video, image, contest or coupon you publish will get countless eyeballs in this breeding ground with 2.2 billion users.</p>
<p>Myth #2: <strong>Marketing Should Define Future Products&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>It is believed that marketing group allegedly has a grip on what consumers want or prefer in a product or services, as characterized by a list of &#8220;market requirements.&#8221;  Though, in many cases, the marketing group doesn&#8217;t know much about customers’ requirements because of the communication gap. Most of the vendors only know about their current accounts think they want in the future.</p>
<p>Myth #3: <strong>Social media Heals Reputation Wounds</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/how-to-market-a-product">Marketing is all about promoting products to make sales</a>. Not taking care about website feedback is not helpful here. Receiving that outraged Rip-off Report is enough to put an end to your business reputation in search engine results. Each word you say matters a lot and cannot be taken back. In case of any problem, make sure that your social media pages possess active administrators authorized to alleviate any problem immediately, individually and systematically. Well, this myth is true at some extent.</p>
<p>Myth #4: <strong>No need to evaluate social success By Communal Interactions</strong></p>
<p>Sales opportunities or profits should measure the ultimate success you get through social interactions. Interactions may also help you with sales opportunities; but, if you don’t close any of those leads, the campaign will be nothing but a disappointment, regardless of how many interactions were bred. Marketing is about drive higher sales in which evaluation is essential to know which strategy is functional.</p>
<p>Myth #5: <strong>Marketing Costs Nothing</strong></p>
<p>The marketing industry is booming on each successive day. The scope and the benefits your business will get are countless. With such broader scope, the industry plays a vital role in creating employment and also fruitful socio-economic progress. Though the use of social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube are all free to use, hidden costs always exist when applying a social media marketing campaign for most customer boost.</p>
<p>For an active and fetching social media promotion, you need an expert who prioritizes and implements the plan, be able to message, and monitors the mediums for customer response. And it is apparent that he will charge heavy bucks for this job.</p>

<h1>1st tip# Create great content</h1>
<p>If you want to rank high in the search engine, then a high content can help you the most. Websites with a fresh, genuine and relevant content are more likely to get a chance to rank. Avoid grammatical mistakes and spelling lower. The question, how long the content should be? must be popping in your mind. Well, there’s no exact answer to it, but it should be at least not smaller than 500 words. In fact, for many, it is good minimum length for a typical blog post.</p>
<p>If we go with research, then it has shown that posts longer than 1000 words tend to rank better. Search engine likes authoritative posts with more than 2000 words. It means, if you want to improve your ranking chances in the future with in-depth articles or blogs, you have to focus on both quality and quantity. The content must be excellent in quality, should be more than 2000 words. So, try to make your writings fun to read, avoid being too much promotional, don’t be boring and assure your content should not look like a legal document. As an alternative, opt for friendly, amusing content.</p>
<h2>2nd tip# Build backlinks to your website</h2>
<p>You need to link your web content with other internal custom web pages. This would be beneficial to your audience, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">will help improve your website’s SEO</a>, make it comfortable for readers to find something useful from your site.</p>
<h2>3rd tip# Optimized URLs</h2>
<p>It will benefit you more if you put keywords in URLs.  Make sure, the keywords you’re putting should be relevant and not inadequate.</p>
<h2>4th tip# Page titles</h2>
<p>Your website’s page must possess compelling and relevant title with some keywords. The title should be descriptive enough to grasp by the readers about the content. For instance, if your blog is about “Effective Logo Designing,” then a great title should be “Effective Logo Designing in ten easy tips” or “<a href="https://www.designhill.com/design-blog/simple-logo-design-recognition/">How to create an effective logo for your business</a>.” However, make sure that your page title should not longer than 70 characters. Although Google will index lengthier page titles, they will be shortened in the search results.</p>
<h2>5th tip# Header tags</h2>
<p>It would be perfect to incorporate the keyword phrase in a header tag, but make sure you’re not spoiling it. The ideal way to include a keyword phrase in a header tag is to use the first heading on the web page as the search engine will pay more attention to H1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6th tip# Make your Professional Web page load faster</h2>
<p>For search engine how much time your website takes in load matters a lot. In fact, it is ranking factor for Google. New case study sheds light that when search engine added website speed into the Algorithm, sites that took more than five minutes to load had to face a severe drop in traffic from search engine. That means fixing page load speed is necessary which can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check how much time your website takes to load.</li>
<li>Optimize your website or web page to improve the overall performance of it.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re using a shared hosting server, you can try switching to a different hosting provider to see if it makes a positive difference. Measure performance again after making changes.</li>
<li>See if your website has any unnecessary things, remove all of them quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow these tips and optimize your high impact web pages.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">are you hoping to increase sales on your website</a>? If yes, then you’re at the top of the ladder. Transform your website’s conversion rate with these six actions to escalate website sales and turn site visitors into permanent followers:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/11/5-best-social-media-marketing-services-instantly-impact-sales/">5 Best Social Media Marketing Services That Instantly Impact Sales</a></p>
<h1>1.    One Brand, One Product, One Target Market</h1>
<p>If your website is selling a wide range of products and services, then must test whether this strategy is effective for making more sales or not. It has been found that proposing not more than two products in one place always translates into higher sales. Offering one product is ideal for one target market. And It is better to focus on one product and answers all the queries of your customers related to that product. Instead of trying to gratify your site visitors by giving them a large variety of products with less information about each service or product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>2.    Keep Up your website with Customers</h1>
<p>Do you know what’s more to focus on your website? It is your customers. <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/successful-sales-pages/">The most effective sales copy emphases on its customers or reader</a>. Unfortunately, many businesspersons do not give importance to this simple golden rule. Be very careful about your sales copy. See if it is filled with references to &#8220;I,&#8221; &#8220;me&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221;? It is always better to use “you” and “your” in content.  By so doing, you are assuring customer’s importance and making content customer-centric and increase sales on site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>3.    Search engines love Fresh web-content</h1>
<p>Fresh, good web content helps to gain trustworthiness, reliance and ultimately sales from the people who visit your website. Start with brainstorming, see how you can make your web content more useful. Make sure your site looks professional, fresh and genuine. It must include your mission statement and possess relevant information about you and your services. The best web content should be user-centric. It should offer the information your visitors pursue and to present it in engaging and organized manner.</p>
<p>Here are some effective tips to help make your web content fresh and good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use conversational Language.</li>
<li>Use acquainted terminologies.</li>
<li>Offer all the relevant information.</li>
<li>Prefer real photos for your site. They work best.</li>
<li>Explain why your business is uniquely equipped to offer its products or services.</li>
<li>Keep your web content always up-to-date</li>
<li>Mention your contact information in multiple places</li>
<li>Clearly explain to your site visitors what you would like them to do next</li>
<li>Proofread your content. See, if it’s free from grammatical mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>4.    Get More Sales with Social Networking</h1>
<p>Having great content on website is good. But, it is not enough to produce high content and make the expectation that visitors find it – you have to control a whole situation rather than just responding to it after any mishap has happened. You have to get social to boost website traffic. Use different social media channels to promote your content. With 1.4 billion users, Facebook is ideal for interacting with customers. Twitter has more than 300 million, is renowned as a momentous brand awareness driving force. Pinterest is a giant in attracting predominantly female audiences. Instagram is popular among the young audience.</p>
<p>No matter what social media channel you’re opting for, your web content must always be geared toward reaching those visitors who can become potential customers or true fan.</p>
<h1>5.    SEO can never get old.</h1>
<p>The practice is valuable and worth more than before. There are two types of SEO: on-page and off-page. The techniques like creating internal links to your content, making the most of image alt text, giving importance to Meta descriptions are still considered as the backbone of On-page SEO. They help boost your organic traffic. On the other hand, off page SEO techniques can be used to improve the position of a website in the SERPs. The techniques include: Contribute as Guest Author, Forum submissions, Blog Directory Submission, Article Submission, Influencer Outreach and the list is endless.</p>
<h1>6.    Keywords still matter</h1>
<p>If you want more traffic, more leads, and better sales, then you’ll have to learn the proper use of keyword optimization to get more business. In keywords, you have two choices: Short-tail keywords and long-tail keywords. Short tail keywords are search watchwords with only one or two words. Long-tail keywords are broader, have three or more words.  Long tail keywords are more targeted and have significant search volume. Before going to actual keyword research, take some quality time to ask a few questions to yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is my audience?</li>
<li>Type of content my readers want to read</li>
<li>What should I offer as a solution for my customers?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also take help with keyword tools and get hundreds of keyword suggestions for your site, personalized to your industry and place.</p>

Days gone by, it was easy to drive tons of traffic by relying on one or two traffic boosting strategies, not today. The more you have streams of driving traffic, the more you will have a chance to improve your site conversion.</p>
<p>There are thousands of ways to groom website traffic, but, I have covered several usual ways using which you will surely generate traffic to your website by just spending a few minutes:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/11/3-awesome-design-techniques-create-better-cta-button/">3 Awesome Design Techniques for Create Better CTA Button</a></p>
<h1>Optimize Your Custom Website</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Optimizing a website to SEO tends to increase website’s ranking.</a> Choose the relevant words to target in your SEO campaigns to increase website traffic. Try to target relevant keywords with searcher’s intent in mind. And if you offer any services, create content around these keywords.</p>
<h1>Give a New Life to Your Old Content and Update It</h1>
<p>This tactic is becoming more popular than ever.</p>
<p>No point in posting more and more articles or blogs on the website if no one will ever read them. Instead, you should discover the web pages that are already giving you traffic, and it is better to update those pages for traffic growth. In fact, Google considers websites with the updated content and will rank them higher in a search engine. Many sites are using this tactic, and you should have to follow them.</p>
<h1>Prefer Some Paid Social Media Promotion</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/importance-social-media-business/">Each social media platform works significantly in advertising and cheaper than many other means of advertising</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter cover almost every audience, allow you to know about competitors and stand out among them. Pinterest is perfect for visual-related businesses, designs, etc. LinkedIn is the best option to target business professionals and getting a high ROI. Choose the best platform according to your niche.</p>
<h1>BLOGGING – Perfect Public Relations Tool</h1>
<p>Blogging drives high traffic. According to the case study blogging can result in 300% traffic boost in just 56 days. And this isn’t rare; another company also ran a similar experiment with even better results.</p>
<p>When you write a blog determine the main keywords that bring visitors to the website. Publish a quality blog post on a consistent basis. Ask questions that are related to your topic and also allow their responses and views. Establish a strong network with other blogs. Share your blog post on different social media platforms.</p>
<h1>Use Email Marketing, It Still Matters</h1>
<p>Email marketing is another usual way to drive traffic to the website. A newsletter is a fantastic tool for driving traffic. Make sure that you have a newsletter opt-in on your site. I would suggest you to use Drip. It’s free and fun to use.</p>
<h1>Make Sure Your Site Is Fast and Responsive</h1>
<p>It is very important for your website to be responsive on both devices: desktop and mobile. Along with responsiveness, the website should be fast as if it fails to load within three seconds then your bounce rate will sky high.</p>
<h1>Keep an Eye on Analytics Data</h1>
<p>Do not take your site analytics for granted, study analytics of your site and use extracted information in improving your content strategies. For the respective purpose, Google analytics is a reliable tool use to optimize website performance and conversions.</p>
<p>Consider mentioned ways to groom your website traffic. Hopefully, they’ll take your website traffic to the sky.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong>Optimizing Images</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Another way to make your site SEO friendly is to optimize images with texts.</a> Just name your images descriptively, optimize your alt attributes, choose image dimensions, optimize thumbnails, use image sitemaps and test your images.</p>
<p>In fact, there’re many compression tools available that make the art of image optimization possible. ImageRecycle, OptimiZilla, Tinypng, giftofspeed, and kraken are some of the examples to compress multiple images or files in one go.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>Videos and Infographics</strong></h2>
