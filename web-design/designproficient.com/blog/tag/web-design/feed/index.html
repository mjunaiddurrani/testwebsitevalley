				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently, this is not a normal time in which the whole world is suffering. COVID-19 (Coronavirus) has erupted in millions of people worldwide. Many people have lost their families and increasingly try to feed themselves and their families. For many of us, the future is uncertain. If we have learned something in the past few months, mutual support is the best part of the web design industry.</p>
<h3>Let’s Talk About Web Design Industry</h3>
<p>As the novel coronavirus carries on to spread globally, the website development or design companies and freelancers must be aware of its impact on business and organize accordingly. Coronavirus pandemics are a threat to freelancers and <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">web design companies</a> and their employees, not only from a well-being perception but also from an economic perspective. With the global economy in a difficult time, more and more people are limited to working from home.</p>
<p>The current state of COVID-19 has had a significant economic impact on the business and technology sectors of the public and private sectors. Not only in certain areas in about 100 countries but also personal life.</p>
<p>The official report confirmed that, as in other sectors, the impact on the economy is expected to dropping to -13%, contracting 1.7% next year, and slowing growth in the first two quarters of this year.</p>
<h3>Significant Impact on Supply Chain</h3>
<p>With rapid growth, now is the right time for technology and web development companies to reduce risk and design solutions. The virus caused delays in some essential meetings related to large-scale technology and web development that had a significant impact on business. As the number of confirmed cases worldwide increases, the results will be much more complicated than expected. There is no doubt that people are trying to work at their location, but due to delays in planning and collaboration opportunities, they are still unable to provide accurate results.</p>
<h3>Impact on Productivity and Performance</h3>
<p>In general, the virus has a significant impact on employee productivity and performance, because it is challenging to adjust targets for bonuses, sales, and coincidences when employees are working from home. Daily productivity and performance manipulation are key issues. The most severe loss is for SMEs, who cannot use telework spaces properly. As a result, the company has renounced these employees and reduced salaries. This also has a major impact on the entire business and production.</p>
<h3>How to Cope With This Pandemic:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Website designers need to figure out a way to curtail costs. Consider meeting with new or existing customers on the internet to reduce travel costs and gas charges.</li>
<li>Since web designers and developers have fewer clients these days due to coronavirus threats, they can invest their free time to learn new skills and increasing their knowledge.</li>
<li>Digital platforms working with famous brands are less vulnerable to small and medium-sized businesses. Working with these platforms is an excellent way to increase corporate leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>&#8220;We all suffering from this pandemic, so stay safe, everyone, stay home&#8221;</strong></em></p>

A talented, well skilled designer usually know the game and they are pretty good in getting good clients on board and making an impressive portfolio to sell their talent in the market. However, as a new designer in market, it might be a challenge to sell your skills as new entrants are not much familiar with the tariff and rates.</p>
<p>Here are few things that will allow you to predict bidding rates as a new graphic designer in the market!</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/07/19/importance-unique-content-custom-website/">The Importance of Unique Content for Your Custom Website</a></p>
<h1><strong>Check the market rates</strong></h1>
<p>Check out the freelancing websites such as Fiverr and Upwork and go through the rates quoted by new entrants and professionals both on their gigs. Do a contrast of the average rates by them and predict a suitable price that you shall quote to your very first client.</p>
<h2><strong>Project Rates vs. Hourly rates</strong></h2>
<p>There is a different pricing schedule for projects and if you work for someone on hourly basis. All you have to be careful about is what goes out of your wallet before deciding your charges. As a freelancer or home based designer, you have to sensibly evaluate your overheads which includes the electricity and internet. If you are based in an office, your cost breakup shall also include your office expenses. If you use any subscription based resources such as Shutterstock, its subscription break-up shall also make its place in your invoice.</p>
<h2><strong>Apps and Software Cost</strong></h2>
<p>Apps and Software are paid and as a designer you should recover the payment through your work especially if your client is not tech savvy and doesn’t know much about technology and its cost. Photoshop costs £20 a month while Adobe CC kit costs around £45 a month. If you are using one of the apps from Adobe kit, each might cost you somewhere around £20. There even are paid invoice generating software which you might need to use.</p>
<h2><strong>Taxation and Licensing </strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>If you work in an office or even as a freelancer in a country where your income is taxed then you must include the taxation in the invoice to get your expense recovered. Licensing of your work is based on the media in which your artwork will be used by the client. For example if you are designing a billboard or a print ad, it is going to be charged high than a flyer, brochure, visiting card or a social media creative. Similarly, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">website designing</a> also has a different schedule of cost.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us spend more than two hours online every day using different devices with screens that require near exclusive attention where more than trillion websites and the same quantity of mobile apps are battling for our valuable time and attention. To make sure you achieve maximum attention of people in your website or app, The Web Founders has selected some crucial tactics or advices to make you stand out from the rest with your exceptional interface.</p>
<p>So, let’s drive&#8230;</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/24/change-brand-web-based-social-media-image-utilizing-design/">HOW TO CHANGE YOUR BRAND WEB-BASED SOCIAL MEDIA IMAGE UTILIZING DESIGN?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>1.    BE CAREFUL WITH NEW UI PATTERNS</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/design/10-quick-tips-for-uiux-design/">Do not make your audience to think too hard about the interface elements</a>. Most of the elements are already known to users. By this I meant, CTA should look like CTA, Links should look like links and so on.</p>
<p>There is no need to get too creative with common patterns or designs. It might sound exciting to do something out of the box or unique with them, but that does not mean usable. Usability and creativity need to be well-adjusted.</p>
<h1>2.    BE CAREFUL ABOUT SIMPLICITY</h1>
<p>It takes no longer than five seconds for users to judge your website, or whether they’re interested or not, so just be careful about what you want users to do on your site. Consider things that help you to make it easy to use. For the respective purpose, prefer consistent design, it is more straightforward or familiar for visitors because it reprocesses constituents, shades, and aesthetic to lessen the requirement for visitors to rethink.</p>
<h1>3.    BE DIRECT AND STAY HONEST</h1>
<p>By staying honest with yourself and visitors, you can convey your message with confidence. Honesty with a user works more than your thinking. So, for this purpose consider social proof instead of just talking about potentials. Nothing will upsurge your conversion as utterly as being honest with the customers.</p>
<h1>4.    COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CUSTOMERS</h1>
<p>Knowing who your users are, is crucial to make the interface most comfortable for them. For this, you have to select the audience relevant to your business. For example, if your website is about stylish chic outfits for women, choose women who want to wear such modern clothes. After targeting the audience, research on them to know their preferences and desires.</p>
<h1>5.    THINK HOW USERS WILL USE YOUR INTERFACE</h1>
<p>Before designing interface, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">you need to see how visitors will use your website or interface.</a> People landing on your site use it in two ways:</p>
<p>Directly: interacting with the elements of the product.</p>
<p>Indirectly: interacting with an element external to the product.</p>
<h2>Instances of direct interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Taking a card</li>
<li>Tapping a button</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping an item with a fingertip</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instances of indirect interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using key commands and shortcuts</li>
<li>Indicating and clicking with a mouse</li>
<li>Drawing on a Wacom tablet</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>6.    SET EXPECTATIONS</h1>
<p>Most of the interactions – directly or indirectly – have some consequences and sometimes, also anxiety. But, you can eliminate this anxiety of users by allowing your users know what will happen just after clicking that particular button before they do it. You can do this through thoughtful design. Highlight the CTA button with appropriate color that has strong meaning. Like we all know green is for a ‘go’ and red for ‘stop.’ You can also use widely understood symbols in a blend with the copy.</p>
<h1>7.    GIVE RESPONSE—FAST</h1>
<p>We are living in a world where environment gives us feedback or respond to our every action. Do you remember to know the stimulus and response theory? The theory implicates here &#8212; We speak, and others respond, or they speak, we respond.</p>
<p>When it comes to your website make sure it all happens quick. Any delay over 2-second mark as an interruption and more than that is enough to cause a bounce. So make your site fast and remove all unnecessary barriers for your users.</p>
<h1>8.    RECOGNITION TO RECALL</h1>
<p>This principle is psychological, suggests, if you have many choices, it is not that hard for you to recognize something already known. Recognition principle should be used wisely to make an experience more comfortable for users. The challenge with recognition is to give users familiar elements which they have been exposed to earlier, instead of expecting them to have a creative idea.</p>
<h1>END OF THE LINE</h1>
<p>So, these are some of tips we have gathered from different sources and experts. Hopefully, they will work for your website..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media with 3 billion social network users around the world can be used for a range of purposes. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">The platform gives you the perfect opportunity to reach your target audience, build your product and know your rivals in the market.</a></p>
<p>Social media branding is all about the experience audience have with your product virtually. When it’s done correctly, it can and will help you connect to your target market in an ideal way.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we have to bring some little changes in our social media profiles. However, these type of changes come with quite a bit of stress and can be an overwhelming experience. In fact, it can put your online reputation in danger.</p>
<p>To be very honest, rebranding is not an easy task, if not done correctly can end up with a disaster. Proper planning, preparation, and thorough research are the things you must have to do before changing or launching your new Brand web-based social media image</p>
<p>So, let’s begin the journey:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/23/5-awesome-practices-responsive-web-design-professional-web-design-company/">5 AWESOME PRACTICES OF RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN FOR PROFESSIONAL WEB DESIGN COMPANY</a></p>
<h1>Firstly, Why Change the Image of Brand Web-Based Social Media?</h1>
<p>Before going through the process, we should see why we need to change to bring a change:</p>
<ul>
<li>When changing core values of your business</li>
<li>When you observe visuals are not interactive</li>
<li>When you have to reach a new audience</li>
<li>When you’re entering a new market</li>
<li>When you’re changing your product offerings</li>
</ul>
<p>Then,</p>
<h2>1.    Process with Highly-Organized Manner</h2>
<p>For many people, just the mere thought of getting organized can be intimidating. Keeping yourself organized is one of your strengths, it&#8217;s a habit everyone should get into. And here, you cannot ignore the importance of organizing your efforts.</p>
<p>When it comes to rebranding your business in social media, it&#8217;s crucial to realize that you only get one chance at a first impact, and hurrying the process can end up with a serious blunder. Well, thorough-research is your knight in shining armor. So, research everything from the social media platforms to the new expected audience and everything.</p>
<h2>2.    Let Your Audience Know About Your Plans</h2>
<p>Your followers, lovers, and customers should know about each and everything you’re going to do about your business. Not just to avoid panic, also connecting your social media community with your brand, it is crucial. By doing this, you’ll get their recognition, trust and probably their sweet help.</p>
<h2>3.    Research Each Social Media Platforms</h2>
<p>Whether it’s branding or rebranding social media profiles, the thorough research of each platform is a way to shoot. Once you have all your work organized, inform the audience about your plans, it’s time to find out the limitations behind each social media platform that might limit your capacity to change your Brand web-based social media profile. For instance:</p>
<p>Facebook – With 1.86 billion monthly active users, Facebook, is a great medium to market your brand, however, when it comes to rebranding page, this tool is overly defensive. Like, if you have more than 200 likes, you cannot switch your business page name. However, you have to make an entirely new page and in the result losing old followers.</p>
<p>LinkedIn – The rebranding is more complicated and more stringent here. Group profiles can change not more than five times, whereas for changing Company Pages you have to contact the LinkedIn Help Center &#8212; which is the daunting task.</p>
<p>Twitter – Comparatively, it gives you a quick and straightforward solution to change username and profile information.</p>
<h2>4.    Make No Compromise with Professionalism and Consistency</h2>
<p>It is crucial for you to update all your social media profiles on the same day, before your declaration. It will help you to deliver a professional image of your company to the people. To reduce the possibility of misunderstanding, make sure that your messages are consistent across all platforms.</p>
<h2>5.    Remember: It is more than just Changes names</h2>
<p>Of course,<a href="https://moz.com/blog/how-to-rebrand-your-social-media-accounts"> a rebranding is more than just switching names on social media networks</a>. You have to make sure your social media messages are well-aligned with your content, and PR. You also have to answer back to the people reaching out to you.</p>
<p>The goals should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make our followers pleased with the rebrand.</li>
<li>Answer all questions or queries, promptly, about the brand.</li>
<li>Have full coverage for launch.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, these are the things you have to make sure when changing your social media brand image. I hope, all these mentioned content might help you.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever we go to any site, we have a goal in mind. To achieve that goal, we usually need to take a series of action, and by clicking call to action button, the first step starts to begin. CTA buttons on your site allow you to guide site visitors towards goal conversion. Some of the famous CTA button examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for the newsletter</li>
<li>Want more information</li>
<li>Get the details</li>
<li>Start a Trial</li>
<li>Download the app/book/guide</li>
</ul>
<p>The main goal of CTA button is to draw readers’ attention through its compelling design, indulging stories, and other things.</p>
<p>So here are few design techniques to do for better CTA button:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/10/5-subtle-metrics-make-destroy-website/">5 SUBTLE METRICS THAT COULD MAKE OR DESTROY YOUR WEBSITE</a></p>
<h1>1.    Visually Striking Button</h1>
<p>The color matters whether it is your website or your CTA button. Consider your CTA button as it is the only way to stand out among your peers with giving those buttons appealing colors and prominence. I would suggest you to use contrasting colors to create those striking buttons stand out. With contrast colors also use negative space around it to separates CTA buttons from other interface elements.</p>
<h1>2.    Action Oriented Text</h1>
<p><a href="https://masterful-marketing.com/create-a-website-call-to-action-that-converts/">Creating a call to action button that will make your website visitors to take immediate action</a> is a daunting task. Luckily, there are several things you can do to make it outstanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be beneficial for your website if your CTA button begins with a verb. Like, the CTA button “Enter for more information” is less appealing than “Start your free trial.” The difference in between two can be elusive but has different impacts on conversion.</li>
<li>Make sure your CTA button is brief and easy to understand by the users. Keep your button text in between 2-5 words.</li>
<li>When writing your call to action, it is important to incorporate one of these persuasive words: Free, Bonus, and instantly.</li>
<li>Creating a sense of urgency in your call to action buttons can help you in getting extra click-through rates. Like, the call to action button “Sign Up and Get 30% Off Today Only!” is a good example to make individuals want to claim their offer while they can.</li>
</ul>
<h1>3.    Less Is More</h1>
<p>Remember if you want people on your website to take immediate action, you have to guide them properly by eliminating all the existing and potential problems from their way. When people find difficult to use your website or see so many options, they get muddled. So, it is best to offer them only one option.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">if you want to add multiple CTA buttons on your website</a>, give importance to one CTA button to help users to focus on one thing at a time. You can also consider Evernote for this approach.</p>
<p>But, what will happen when your call to action button doesn’t stand out?</p>
<p>I have already mentioned that how important it would be to possess compelling CTA buttons on your website. If you fail to make your CTA button stand out, then you’ll fail to succeed.</p>
<p>Which call to action button is more compelling to make website conversion better is important to know. Keep this in your mind that split-testing alone never tell you this. You have to put your efforts in it.</p>
<p>Give mentioned designs a try and make your CTA button rocket and so increase your website conversion with these buttons.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things like: death, taxes, and a question from people asking ‘So what do you do for a living’ are constant. But some things are not. Like, to give a suitable answer about how it should be a UX designer can be muddling even for many custom product designers.</p>
<p>I have seen so many people dealing with lots of problems in nailing down the answer of how to be a UX designer?</p>
<p>This is what I got from an expert:</p>
<p>“To be a UX designer, it is just like to be inside your users’ brain, to perceive design from the user’s perspective and to resolve expected confusions of users.”</p>
<p>It is like a never-ending route that requires keeping user experience prior more than anything. Though it is challenging to feel like a user, it is not impossible.</p>
<p>To guide your product design and make it bloom, I’ve collected several essential UX principles:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/28/5-unexpected-social-media-marketing-trends-professional-social-media-services2018/">5 Unexpected Social Media Marketing Trends in professional social media services2018</a></p>
<h1>Product Design Should Be Digestible:</h1>
<p>It would be easy to absorb or digest the product if it is simple and fulfils all the demands of users. You don’t need to spend lots of time or energy to see what things work. Consider all the things that help your product to make it the bottom of the funnel and opt the best one.</p>
<p>Design should be readable and easy to use to make users decide what to do. Users need proper guidelines, and you can do so by maintaining hierarchy and consistency in typography.</p>
<h1>Should Have Clarity:</h1>
<p>Beside things mentioned above, clarity is another thing that adds value to your product. One has to be very clear about his/her product.</p>
<p>With clarity in design, I mean to be very clear about product’s pricing. If users find any difficulty in figuring the price of a product, they’ll probably not buy that product. Therefore, it is important to mention price with ‘buy now’ ticker for better UX.</p>
<p>Making things as clear as possible should be your goal.</p>
<h1>Should Build Trust:</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">It is easy to trust if the design is good.</a> With honesty and clarity in explaining product’s features, one can build trust and increase conversions.</p>
<p>Consider Uber and its stress-free ride service. It is highly successful brand and a perfect example of building trust with consumers.</p>
<h1>Should Possess Familiarity:</h1>
<p>It is good if your product design is ground-breaking, but it should convert better. <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/10-ux-design-predictions-for-2018/">Offering entirely new framework and layout can be a UX killer.</a></p>
<p>Consider all the famous frameworks and layouts. Pay careful attention to each detail and use familiar patterns in your product to give it a native look.</p>
<h1>Should Be User-centric</h1>
<p>Being a product designer, you should have to build a thoughtful product with clear insight and intentions. The respective behavior towards product shows that you care about your users. It is also important as more than 60% of users give up your product just because they think you don’t care about them.</p>
<h1>WRAPPING IT UP</h1>
<p>It is quite easy to make the product as according to the UX canons. All you have to do is be very honest with yourself and perform each action from users’ perspective.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Goals are crucial in life, and one must have. Without which one cannot go with success in his/her life. Goals help you to motivate and focus on the essential things, allow you to measure progress, and help you overcome procrastination</p>
<p><em>Begin with the end (goal) in mind.</em></p>
<p>&#8211; Stephen Covey</p>
<p>Especially, being a designer, you cannot go without setting goals. In fact in designing, if you fail to set a goal, you plan to fail.</p>
<p>Creating a website that appeal masses must be a primary goal of any businessperson or designer. Remember a great site doesn’t only looks good but must have more than it.</p>

<p>After spending hours on the internet, I’ve collected some useful goal-setting elements for your new website, so read on:</p>

<h1><strong> MAKE USER-FRIENDLY WEBSITE:</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Always try to create a user-friendly or user-centric <a href="https://www.cludo.com/blog/search-vs-navigate-people-behave-websites-search-navigate/">website that helps visitors to navigate or search things on the site easily.</a></p>
<p>Try to focus on visibility, maintain the white space on your website and make your site pleasant with visual design. Bring consistency in typography and also use relevant interactive visuals with the text. Give attention to each thing; it can help you produce a user-centric site.</p>
<p>UX sins to be avoided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inconsistency in typography</li>
<li>Use of irrelevant images and videos on site</li>
<li>Neglecting Prototyping</li>
<li>Avoid proper alignments</li>
<li>Give a messy perception of the website to the visitors</li>
</ul>
<p>Your customers or users are everything. Don’t do anything that hurts or harm UX. Just read the canons of UI/UX, and follow them properly while designing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong> KNOW YOUR BRAND AND AUDIENCE</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s your brand persona or niche is? What your targeted customers are? These two questions should be given importance when making a website. As the site is your brand’s online existence in the market, it should represent your brand’s accurate persona and be capable of interacting with the customers/audience.</p>
<p>I’ve already discussed the importance of audience and user-centric site. So I won’t discuss it for long, but the website should be about your brand.</p>
<p>Know:</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>What your business nature is?</p>
<p>How can I stand out my website in the competitive market?</p>
<p>What character traits help me to make site outshine</p>
<p>Consider these questions, address them and make your site accordingly.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> WEBSITE SPEED</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure that your new site is free from extra load. Adding excessive elements/things on the site make it overloaded and take more time to load.</p>
<p>Slow-speed is a UX killer, can drop viewership by 50%. Test your website speed and if it’s running slow then lessen or eliminate excessive elements from the site.</p>
<p>Here are some useful tips to speed up your site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a good host</li>
<li>Optimize large images</li>
<li>Avoid bulky visuals</li>
<li>Minify resources</li>
<li>Enable Compression</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, I would say that creating a website isn’t as simple as you think. You have to start with a SMART goal.</p>
