<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/18/optimize-high-impact-web-pages/">How to optimize High impact web pages</a></p>
<h1>Facebook</h1>
<p>With 1.1 billion users monthly, more than 600 million active users daily and 650 million page views per week, the platform has proved its popularity where people can go to leave a message. With such colossal audience span, creating a page for business is necessary with daily updates with both engaging and exciting content. Try not to be so much promotional in this platform.</p>
<h1>Twitter</h1>
<p>The platform is full of interesting people, most of them are young. Today, the channel has more than 200 million active users. The 140 characters count of a tweet might be limited, but if it’s being used wisely, then it will payback you more than your thoughts. Twitter has its worth, importance to connect with people you want to interact with. And the good news is, once you get succeeded in gaining some popularity your account will take no time to go viral.</p>
<h1>YouTube</h1>
<p>YouTube is the most popular channel after Facebook. This video oriented site allows you create a Brand Account to give your business a YouTube presence of its own. With over 1 billion monthly visitors, it is the second largest search engine after Google. The YouTube market is competitive that invites engagement, sharing and theta users will enjoy.</p>
<p>Follow these three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to YouTube.com and sign in with your personal YouTube account credentials.</li>
<li>Create a YouTube Brand Account</li>
<li>Add Managers to your YouTube Brand Account</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the best channel relevant to your business. Keep the niche of your business in front of your mind and pick the most productive one!</p>
<p><strong><em>So, here are some tips:</em></strong></p>
<p>Tip #1: Check out each channel, study them and find out the channel which will work more effectively for your business. Try to consider some of the factors with each channel: The product or service you are offering and the available resources at your disposal. Social media is free, but your time is precious enough to care.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Don’t use every channel or sign up on every platform for just because they’re new in the market or getting popular on the souk. Instead, find out the channel which is most relevant, effective to the business you’ve chosen to appeal your customers.</p>
<p>Tip #3: Before you’re going to decide which channel is more effective to work on, try to work out on a clear and implementable strategy. Many entrepreneurs or marketers lose their business focus while trying to be social. A play helps you actually to stay focused on a particular social channel.</p>
<p>Tip #4:  Everything takes time and might be some investment to show its benefits. Social media is no exception. So, if it’s taking some time, don’t get frustrated. Stick with your channel and strategy. It takes time and an investment of your time over a persistent period to achieve results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Facebook is an important platform not only for social interactions but also for businesses</a>. It helps companies to reach their target audience and even to the competitors in the market. Unfortunately, Facebook’s News Feed algorithm is in a continuous state of uncertainty about what should be done.</p>
<p>The platform with more than 2 billion monthly active users, becoming critical or complicated for business owners to control their entrepreneurship and to have a presence on this platform.</p>
<p>If your business needs help staying up to date with the latest Facebook trends or making the most of its reach on the network, then I’ll let you know that it would be tough this time!</p>
<p>Facebook is changing the algorithm that functions the news feed, which presents a computer-curated selection of posts from other people and pages.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/14/6-easy-tips-increase-sales-website/">6 EASY TIPS TO INCREASE SALES ON YOUR WEBSITE</a></p>
<h1>How this new Facebook Algorithm Affect Me and My Business?</h1>
<ul>
<li>This new feed will display things from the people who are important to you than the things that are important for you.</li>
<li>From now, You will see less annoying stuff like fewer click bait and share=like posts, etc., as the new algorithm of Facebook restricts the number of posts, even though they may have many likes and shares, don’t encourage community engagement through conversation.</li>
<li>You will be going to see comparatively less Facebook videos that annoyed you. They will not blast you with fantastic max volume music and overzealous rattling sales pitches.</li>
<li>Your Facebook posts that people comment on will get more views.</li>
<li>You will see more posts from the people you know, or you love. Especially from those friends and family who you talk to the most. This is a step back, though not a full redaction, of a previous update, which began limiting the number of friends’ posts you see on your news feed.</li>
<li>You will see fewer posts and videos about topics you are interested in and more posts from friends you are interested in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your Facebook Business Strategies Will Have To Change:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The persona of your business will be damage, and your business’ voice will lessen down unless you change your Facebook Business Strategies. Here are some of the reasons:</li>
<li>An organic post which is not paid from brand pages and businesses will be shown a smaller amount than they have been in the previous.</li>
<li>Even the bulk amount of Likes and shares will not help your posts as they used to.</li>
<li>The chances are you may have to buy ads to get the same result, but your ads are more likely to perform better than they used to be.</li>
<li>You need some comments on your Facebook posts to achieve the same amount of popularity once you have earlier. This may not be much of a problem for pages with a massive following, but it can hurt small business pages.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Some Important Strategies:</strong></h2>
<h2>Increase your Social Perspectives or Horizons</h2>
<p>You would not waste your precious time with people who don’t like or ignore you. You can find your new friends. No exceptions with social media. Use some of the time you devote to Facebook to explore other options such as Linkedin, Twitter and YouTube are some names.</p>
<h2>Use More Live Video</h2>
<p>In future, Facebook will be presenting not more video to users, but that doesn’t reckon for live video. Live videos are engaging and Facebook like that. It will rank a live video in your business supporters’ feeds.</p>
<h2>Create Engaging Content</h2>
<p>Always remember that Content is king. So, make sure you are <a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/26-ways-to-create-engaging-content/">making a content that is valuable and engaging</a>. In fact, Facebook favor posts that get more eyeballs. You have to write compelling content relevant to the niche. Likes and shares are essential but not the primary factor in post popularity once the change is carried out. You need content that stimulates the commenting type of engagement.</p>

<p>ALSO READ:<a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/10/google-starting-choke-organic-traffic/"> IS GOOGLE STARTING TO CHOKE ORGANIC TRAFFIC?</a></p>
<h1>Get More Out Of SMM with Facebook Photo Contest</h1>
<p>If you want to engage your users with your post and generate a lead, then run a photo contest on Facebook. It is a smart way to get more eyeballs. You have to use any reliable app to run a contest in a tab on your page, and prompt your followers to submit photos related to your brand. This practice helps you to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">increase engagement and spread awareness of your Facebook page.</a></p>
<p>Beware about the rules of the Facebook contest. These should not be acceptable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like a page to enter</li>
<li>Share a page to join</li>
<li>Share a page on a friends Timeline to enter</li>
<li>Tag yourself in a photo to enter</li>
<li>Like multiple pages to enter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Run a Facebook Live Campaign</h2>
<p>In the past few years, live streaming is becoming more common. In fact, interacting with the fans can multiply a level of trustworthiness and authenticity to your social media marketing. This could be a live interview to answer the queries of your customers related to your brand; taking live calls or messages; to promote your latest line of products. By doing so, you can drive your audience’s attention in your brand.</p>
<h2>Run a Twitter Poll</h2>
<p>Twitter Poll is one of the less-used features. Running a poll on twitter is an excellent way to get engagement from your customers. They are engaging and a smart way to start a discussion with your followers. The Twitter poll offers you with endless options. They allow followers make decisions for you. So, see how these Polls help your business&#8217;s personality shine.</p>
<h2>Host a Livestream on your Instagram Story</h2>
<p>Instagram is a great platform to capture and share the world&#8217;s moments, Follow other, and discover accounts from all around the globe. This community with over 500 million users has made their live video broadcasting feature available for people. Instagram Livestreaming seems quite similar to Facebook live stream, but there’s some difference– the primary difference is that Instagram videos cannot be stored anywhere, meaning your viewers can only watch when you’re genuinely live. Use Instagram’s live video broadcasting and get creative with it and see how your followers respond! Post consistently</p>
<h2>Post Consistently on YouTube</h2>
<p>Give your viewers an enticement to subscribe to your YouTube channel with the guarantee of a constant strain of high-value content. Frequent posting is essential on YouTube just like other platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Your users will not be as fascinated in your channel if they don’t see you posting not regularly. For driving more traffic to channel, the best trick is to influence the traffic you breed on other platforms. Just feature your new video on your homepage and create a new blog post for it.</p>
<h2>End of the Line</h2>
<p>There you go – five simple tips for your professional social media marketing. I sure hope these tips will help you with your social strategy!</p>

For instance:</p>
<p>Facebook – With 1.86 billion monthly active users, Facebook, is a great medium to market your brand, however, when it comes to rebranding page, this tool is overly defensive. Like, if you have more than 200 likes, you cannot switch your business page name. However, you have to make an entirely new page and in the result losing old followers.</p>
<p>LinkedIn – The rebranding is more complicated and more stringent here. Group profiles can change not more than five times, whereas for changing Company Pages you have to contact the LinkedIn Help Center &#8212; which is the daunting task.</p>
<p>Twitter – Comparatively, it gives you a quick and straightforward solution to change username and profile information.</p>
<h2>4.    Make No Compromise with Professionalism and Consistency</h2>
<p>It is crucial for you to update all your social media profiles on the same day, before your declaration. It will help you to deliver a professional image of your company to the people. To reduce the possibility of misunderstanding, make sure that your messages are consistent across all platforms.</p>
<h2>5.    Remember: It is more than just Changes names</h2>
<p>Of course,<a href="https://moz.com/blog/how-to-rebrand-your-social-media-accounts"> a rebranding is more than just switching names on social media networks</a>. You have to make sure your social media messages are well-aligned with your content, and PR. You also have to answer back to the people reaching out to you.</p>
<p>The goals should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make our followers pleased with the rebrand.</li>
<li>Answer all questions or queries, promptly, about the brand.</li>
<li>Have full coverage for launch.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, these are the things you have to make sure when changing your social media brand image. I hope, all these mentioned content might help you.</p>

<h1>Understand each social media platform</h1>
<p>With more than 3 billion active users worldwide, <a href="https://www.spredfast.com/social-marketing-blog/when-social-media-marketing-software-grows">social media is becoming a breeding ground to market yourself.</a> Each platform is different and plays by its own rules. Facebook with two billion users is the most prominent platform to know competitors. Twitter with 328 million monthly users getting lots of attention in a marketing circle. Photo-sharing app, Instagram has higher engagement rates on posts than any other platform. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Choose the best and relevant platform for your marketing. </a></p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Identify your target audience. Understand their inside out. Do research as much as possible and know who they are, what they do, what makes them feel good, what makes them tick, what they expect, and what they think of you.</p>
<h2>Determine your Goals and Objectives</h2>
<p>Goals are broad, intangible, and abstract whereas objectives are tangible, concrete, and measurable. A good objective should clearly answer what, why, when, where, who, and how. Setting goals and objectives you can improve the overall effectiveness of social media marketing.</p>
<h2>Add Compelling Headlines</h2>
<p>Headlines matter and work significantly in changing the way we think about the content. As most of the readers skim headlines and irrelevant headlines lead you off course. Write headlines first and ask yourself about if they conclude the story if it engages the readers and all. You can also conduct A/B testing to know which headline works more in engaging users.</p>
<p>As Felix Salmon suggests “Even with the most appealing headlines in the world, for every individual who clicks on it, there are hundreds, if not thousands, who see it, absorb it, and simply move on. People get their news from headlines now in a way they never did before.”</p>
<h2>Be Who You Are</h2>
<p>Don’t astray your followers by portraying yourself as a fake personality on social media. Be who you are. Be genuine and reflect your authenticity to the posts.</p>
<h2>Post on the Right Time</h2>
<p>No matter how good your post is, timing matters. If your post is for the right readers and on the right time only then you’ll see results. Schedule your post at the best times without making assumptions. Start with targeting your audience, know them, consider their location, use the right scheduling tools, maintain consistency on posts, continue to test, and keep an eye on the competitors.</p>
<p>So these are six steps to market yourself in social media.</p>

<h1>1.    Facebook Page is a Strong Voice For many SMM Agencies</h1>
<p>Have you ever seen or heard the line, the Facebook page is the voice of your business. It is actually true. It is a marketing tool or a voice that allows businesses and social media agencies to identify themselves by sharing links, posts, and images. <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-stats-for-marketers/">Facebook is a great place with 1.2 billion users to let businesses identify themselves.</a></p>
<h2>2.    Facebook Advertising</h2>
<p>Facebook has its own classic ads campaigns, which appear in the side columns. They’re also known as Marketplace Ads which include compelling headlines, picture, and a click-through link to the Facebook app, Facebook page or an outside website.</p>
<p>Facebook ads are being used by more than 5 million advertisers today. In fact, it is a great marketing tool to increase likes and followers on your business page. It will allow you to make more users and gain more conversions.</p>
<h2>3.    Facebook Contest</h2>
<p>Facebook allows brands or businesspersons to run quick and simple contest. It is the most interesting way to connect with the customers and to make new followers. Many contests are running on Facebook. But Facebook photo contest is most popular among all. Just collect most defining images of your product, run hashtag and ask your followers to like and comment. Whatever the nature of your contest is, just make sure that you’re offering your customers attractive prizes of their interests.</p>
<h2>4.    Check Call to Action Buttons on Facebook</h2>
<p>Your customers cannot guess what you want them to do. Whether it is your website or a Facebook page, you need to be very careful about the call to actions to instruct audience about immediate action. Facebook offers seven sorts of CTA: Book now, Contact us, Use App, Play game, sign up, shop now, and watch video. One can easily edit these buttons and link anywhere he likes to drive traffic.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.brackenmarketing.com/blog/content-backbone-biopharma-digital-marketing">Social media has now become the backbone of marketing activities</a>. Various platforms are available where ideas, products, services and brand`s names are promoted. Almost all kinds of audiences are available on social media and marketers only have to drive their attention towards a certain goal.</p>
<p>Like any other medium, there are several marketing trends of social media as well which kept on changing with time and market nature. Selection of right trends at the right moment as per the market requirements related to the product or brand is the key to success in the world of social media.</p>
<p>Here are five unexpected social media marketing trends of 2018.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/27/7-ultimate-logo-design-trend-2018-logo-design-agency/">THE 7 ULTIMATE LOGO DESIGN TREND IN 2018 FOR LOGO DESignageNCY</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Negative marketing by your social media company</h1>
<p>There is a boost of negative or immoral activities to promote the brand or product. Even popular names of the market are involved in such activities. Negative marketing through social media is easy, and such posts get viral at a faster speed than any other mean. Somehow such tactics are supported by some negative-minded audience, and a debate between moral and immoral activities is stated, and the huge audience participates in giving their views.</p>
<p>However negative marketing through social media is a big risk because sometimes the mess ends up with a mammoth loss like the one recently happened with Snap Chat for misusing Rihanna and Clark’s personal issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Support of Positivity</h2>
<p>On the other hand, 2018 trends also include support of positive campaign and initiatives by different organizations or people. Social media marketing gave a boost to campaigns that are thought-provoking. Even very small issues or cultural practices are being supported in the name of marketing of brands and products. The companies link their product to something indirectly to promote the cause and their brand, both at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sensitive Issues</h2>
<p>Many branding strategies include debates and discussions related to sensitive issues of the society. For example, there are several brands who took the initiative to feature fat, short-height, disable, syndrome patients as their models for promotion of their fashion products. They started such trends by posting some modeling pictures on social media and getting a view from the audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Promotion of Local Art and Culture</h2>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">social media marketing</a> is not for a brand or product promotion, but it is also linked to the countries from where the organization belongs. People appreciate and love the posts, images, and ads which promote local art and culture of any country. Artists, who are not legends and too famous but still have good talent get a platform to showcase their strengths meanwhile companies get the attention of the audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Photography and Illustration</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy-pasting of images is now an old way to carry out your marketing activities via social media. Now people want to see the real images of your product.  Quality of product photography is also linked to an increase in sales and lead generation.</p>

<p>In today’s blog, I’ll explain you how digital marketing makes headway in 2018 using different marketing techniques:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/22/design-website-goal-mind/">DESIGN WEBSITE WITH A GOAL IN YOUR MIND</a></p>
<h1><strong>SMM, Get Professional Social Media Services</strong></h1>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it is 2018, New Year, new things on the way. Many things have transformed and are still changing. The way of thinking about digital marketing also changes with trendy strategies.</p>
<p>After spending hours on research, I’ve compiled seven interesting digital marketing strategies that are expected to be common this year. So go through and choose the best one for your product marketing:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/20/9-really-common-web-design-mistakes-avoid/">9 REALLY COMMON WEB DESIGN MISTAKES TO AVOID</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong> Increase Use of Voice Search</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the increased use of smartphones or tablets, voice search is also increasing. In fact more than 20% of online searches are conducted through voice search and the rate is expected to increase by 50% in coming five years.</p>
<p>Text-based or voice search are equally important and can significantly affect SEO as well other aspects of marketing.</p>
<p>The huge shift from text-based search to the voice search suggests marketers alter or tweak the way they provide information online.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong> Mobile-Friendly Website </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is crucial for your business to possess online existence or visibility in the market. Your business must have a website that should be both mobile and desktop friendly.</p>
<p>We all know how mobile-friendly sites have been becoming important today. In fact, according to the 2018 business stats, more than 60% of search, browsing or sales happen on mobiles.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong> Video Marketing</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Video content strategy is another hot trend of this year. Grabbing your customers’ attention via interactive video has been considered as one of the most successful digital marketing strategies. Two-fourth of the businesses are using video content for marketing and get more than 50% of leads annually.</p>
<p>You have many options in videos from live streaming to explainer videos and Vlog to animation videos. Try to study every video type and choose the most fruitful one according to your brand persona and niche.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong> Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly Artificial Intelligence has been becoming powerful means where <a href="https://digitalagencynetwork.com/what-a-high-ranking-converting-blog-strategy-looks-like/">marketers can expect high growth in their business.</a></p>
<p>The technology has already been impacting our daily lives. Whether it is about automated transportation or taking over dangerous jobs in the world, A.I works everywhere.</p>
<p>In marketing A.I helps you to build a strong relationship with the customers. The technology is being used to grasp customers’ behavior and even helps in decision-making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2><strong> Blog</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No strategy can work more than writing a blog about your brand. If people know who you are, what you are doing, how you’ve struggled, how you’ve launched your brand, then they’ll show more engagement in your product.</p>
<p>Creating a brand’s blog is trendy. I’ve seen many businesspersons writing blogs about their products and getting decent engagements.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2><strong> Social Media Platform</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
