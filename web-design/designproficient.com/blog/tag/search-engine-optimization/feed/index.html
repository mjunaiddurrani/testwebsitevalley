				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike paid traffic, <a href="https://www.smartbugmedia.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-direct-and-organic-search-traffic-sources">organic traffic refers to non-paid traffic</a>. It includes traffic from search engines, social media sites, referral traffic, and direct traffic. These are the traffic achieved organically, rather than any source of paid promotion or advertising.</p>
<p>Publishing the relevant and high-quality content on blog and website is one way to boost the organic traffic of your site. This is, in fact, most comfortable and functional technique used for obtaining new visitors on the website. SEO &#8211; search engine optimization is the outlet of online marketing that emphases directly on cultivating and boosting organic traffic.</p>
<p>Now, let’s suppose that Google is starting to choke organic traffic and limiting the visitors that can get to a site after searching. What would happen, then?</p>
<p>It’s not daydreaming. It&#8217;s happening now. Doubting how? Here’s how.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/08/brand-something-logo/">Why Your Brand Is Something Other Than Your Logo</a></p>
<h1>The Knowledge Graph</h1>
<p>Since the establishment, The Knowledge Graph has been getting more popularity. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Google is using the Knowledge Graph to enhance its search engine’s services</a> with information collected from a variety of sources. Moreover, this refers to Google’s central database of information on movies, historical events, locations, and other topics; when a user searches any topic, a box on the right-side of the search engine results page will display relevant information to that topic along with links to Google pages for other related topics.</p>
<p>Now, it can be a long debate with a lot of confusions about whether The Knowledge Graph really steals organic traffic or not. No matter what, it is clear that anyone looking for his needed information in these boxes doesn’t require to click a link for any more information.</p>
<h1>Carousels</h1>
<p>What is Carousel? How it links with Google? To make sure a perfect web experience delivers to all its users. Google offers Carousel, the most valuable improvement which takes local search to the next level. Google carousels help people with information. It is quite similar to the concept of Knowledge Graph. Both tend to help users. For instance, if anyone searches for ‘Rampage,’ He’ll come up with individual entries for Dwayne Johnson, Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman, Jake Lacy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and some other stuff related to his search. Now, every single entry links to another page with more specific information on each cast. Let’s say, the biography, the career, the rewards and the list is endless. Principally, it’s another doorway that makes the Knowledge Graph more influential – while making it less likely, users need to visit external websites to find the information they’re eyeing for.</p>
<h1>Videos and Content</h1>
<p>Search engines like GOOGLE, YAHOO, and BING offer text-based and visual content which people is searching for. Especially Google assures with its videos and content offerings to fulfill people search requirements. By guaranteeing this, Google makes its ownership of YouTube treasured. Users also get engage with content without going on to any other web page.</p>
<p>These are only three things I’ve mentioned; there’re many other things which screaming loudly that Google is taking a step to keep users on Google for an extended period (as long as possible) by offering them required answers on their queries.</p>
<p>Somehow, it is the critical or tensing situation, but that doesn’t apply that one should have to lessen down his investment in search engine optimization. Don’t worry, Google cannot provide everything to its users.</p>

Alternately, designers and marketers need to take a more tactical line of attack.

<h1>HIGHLIGHT YOUR CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTONS ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h1>
<p>Placing a call to action on your website is not tough, but putting them in the right place is essential. Build your CTA wisely to get more eyeballs of visitors and induce them to click. Offer your visitors things that they can&#8217;t refuse.</p>
<p>The call to action, better known as the “CTA,” is an appeal to visitors, inviting their response on a webpage, acting as an indication that guides the user through the next steps. If your call to action is not clear enough then the user may not know the following steps to take to purchase a product or sign up for a newsletter. In many cases, visitors leave the website without completing their task.</p>
<h2>USE TWITTER FOR LEAD GENERATION ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h2>
<p>The platform works almost for every business. The task is just to discover the right people and engaging them, which can be as simple as following them or taking part in a conversation. For the respective purpose, you can find people using Twitter search with relevant hashtags or keywords, or use LinkedIn to find specialists. You can also take help with some tools like CrowdFire or Followerwonk. The entire process requires a significant amount of time, but if done wisely, can produce prominent consequences. Of course, you have to link your twitter account with your website.</p>
<h2>TEST, TEST, TEST</h2>
<p>One cannot overlook the importance of this process. Variety of testing options available, among them A/B testing can do wonders for knowing your click-through rates and so making them better.</p>
<h2>CREATE A MICRO LANDING PAGE</h2>
<p>You have not more than five seconds to convince people landing on your website to stick around and spend their valuable time on your site. For the respective purpose, the micro landing page is a full-page popup that comes in response to the user behavior. Creating a well-designed micro landing page and adding to the home page can increase conversion rates more than your thinking.</p>
<h2>USE EXPLAINER VIDEOS</h2>
<p>Explainer videos- <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/longer-is-better/">we all know are a perfect thing for attracting visitors to your site</a> and explaining them about the benefits and features of your product on the website. As the average user spends about 10-20 seconds on a website if there is no convincing reason to stay longer. But, adding things to their interests like explainer videos make them stay longer on your site. Moreover, it has emerged as one of the best tools for lead generation.</p>
<h2>END OF THE LINE</h2>
<p>Lastly, leads are imperative, not catching the lead means that website’s visitors are probably lost forever. In fact, lead generation site has noticeable differences compared to the rest.

<h1>1.  POWERFUL CONTENT WITH WISE USE OF KEYWORDS</h1>
<p>Being a website owner, it is up to you what type of content you’re putting on your site. Whether it is about technology, science, health, politics or any other topic. Just make sure you’re putting high-quality material relevant to your business.</p>

To understand the strategy of behind which keyword would be suitable and which is not, just think about your customers or readers. How they’ll search your content from Google and what keywords they’ll write. After acknowledging right keywords apply them on your webpage, wisely. Remember adding excessive keywords can be destructive for your site. Don’t add more than six keywords in a single page.</p>
<h2>2.    UPDATE YOUR SITE</h2>
<p>Try to update your content on a  regular basis. Frequent posting on the website not only give your site a new life but also allow visitors to view or share fresh content. In fact, most of the website’s owners follow the same tactic just to assure if they’re getting chance of better ranking in Google. Wikipedia is one of the famous sites which updates its content very frequently.</p>
<h2>3.    SPEED UP YOUR WEBSITE</h2>
<p>Your web-page loading speed is an important matter which you cannot take for granted. If a website takes more than 2-sec in loading then probably it will lose a high chance of ranking in future. The delay in page loading can bother users, adversely affects bounce rate, conversion, sales and overall hurts site’s SEO.</p>
<p>Don’t worry. You can easily protect your site by lessening or eliminating all the bulky-size videos, images, and additional plugins.</p>
<h2>4.  ADD BACKLINKS</h2>
<p>Uploading a high-quality content with relevant keywords is essential. But, adding outbound links on the content can also work more than wonders.</p>
<p>Just make sure, you’re linking an appropriate or relevant site on your webpage. Don’t add extra backlinks, as excessive backlinks discourage readers to grasp the content.</p>
<p>Outbound Links not only help you with your site ranking but also help you to build a strong relationship with other sites.</p>
<h2>5.  READABILITY</h2>
<p>It is a mistake to think, ‘intricate, complex and difficult text as classy’ about which designer has to be very clear. Remember, it is not an appropriate way to go. Instead, you should use clear, simple, vague-less, familiar, and readable text or content to grab visitors‘attention.</p>
<p>Making your web content up to the canons of readability is another way to get better position or ranking in Google. According to some experts, <a href="https://www.protofuse.com/blog/details/6-seo-reasons-why-blogs-arent-ranking-getting-traffic/">Google considers readability of your website in raking.</a></p>

<h1>Choose Specific Topic for Site</h1>
<p>Pick any one topic and try to stick with it.  You cannot appeal every other person. The same goes for the website. Therefore, the designer should focus on targeted audience and one topic. Think about your website’s purpose, choose the specific topic, set target audience demographics and make your site accordingly.</p>
<h2>Use Keywords Wisely</h2>
<p>Keywords are the king, serves the important purpose. But the wise use of keyword can only help you with your site ranking. That particular thing of your site (the topic of the site) should be mentioned where they matter; in title and description. The designer should also add keywords not only in texts but on the images. H1, H2, H3 are just not headings but have other functions as well. They can change the game of keyword settings.</p>
<h2>Add Backlinks to the page</h2>
<p><a href="https://yoast.com/successful-linkbuilding-strategy/">Link-building is another strategy</a> that works. You should add links of other relevant pages on your web page. Adding backlinks to the page help you increase the site rankings.</p>
<h2>Avoid Unnecessary Content</h2>
<p>Delays in page loading can be harmful to the site because if users find any difficulty in loading they will quickly switch to any other website. So, while designing a website just be careful about the addition of non-essential things. Enormous visual content, too much content and even unnecessary plugins can be a reason for the delay while loading a website.</p>
<h2>Update Regularly</h2>
<p>Update your site frequently because if your website’s content is getting older then it is also losing a chance of ranking. Most of the companies update their sites just to ensure if they get a better chance of ranking.</p>
<p>Fresh content is a fuel of the site, which not only renews your site but also works well for social media as people want to read and share new content and eventually benefits<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing"> SEO.</a></p>
<h2>Use Genuine and Quality Content</h2>
<p>The designer should prefer quality content instead of stealing others material. Stealing content is easy and a quick way to start a business website but it can ruin your investment as well. Copied content is not SEO friendly and Google marks it as spam.</p>
<p>Add unique articles or blogs, use the interactive visual content to appeal visitors. Even site with unique content is 50% more likely to get chance of getting more visitors than the site without genuine content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Make your site Easy-to-navigate for the visitors</h2>
