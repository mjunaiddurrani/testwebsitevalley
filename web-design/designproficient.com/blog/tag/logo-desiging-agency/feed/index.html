				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether your business is about medicine, food, sport or anything else. It does not matter what the nature of your business is – it is crucial to design logos in timeless and memorable manner. <a href="https://www.bluesodapromo.com/blog/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-logo-design/">For designing a logo, it is important to understand certain things</a>. Every single line, shape, color, and form are important in making a conscious decision when it comes to design a logo for your business.</p>
<p>So, in this blog, I’ll talk about the important concept – a Figure-Ground relationship that will help you create a timeless business logo. Let’s look what it’s all about!</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/13/design-matters-rebrand-brand/">WHY DESIGN MATTERS FOR REBRAND YOUR BRAND</a></p>
<h1>SO, WHAT IS FIGURE-GROUND RELATIONSHIP IN CUSTOM LOGO FOR YOUR BUSINESS?</h1>
<p>Figure and ground are two terms with different meanings. The figure refers to the positive space in the logo design. Whereas, ground refers to the background or negative space in the emblem. Commonly, a logo is visually prevailing in the figure. Sometimes, the elements of the figure are ground dominating instead of being figure dominant.</p>
<h2>WHY THE CONCEPT IS IMPORTANT FOR CUSTOM LOGO DESIGNERS?</h2>
<p>When it comes to the importance of Figure-Ground relationship in logos, look Gestalt Principle. It will tell you that design is perceived as a unified whole. Figure-Ground Relationship is an extension of the Gestalt Principle.</p>
<p>When people view a logo, they see individual elements and categorize it in relationships. It means negative space is equally important as positive space because both spaces exist in relation and depend on each other.</p>
<h2>KINDS OF FIGURE GROUND RELATIONSHIPS:</h2>
<p>There are three types of figure-ground relationships. These are:</p>
<h2>1.    Constant Figure-Ground Relationship:</h2>
<p>This type allows a person to differentiate a ground and figure in the logo design easily. For making logo stable enough, the designer has to make one thing dominant over other. For instance, they can make negative space more prominent over positive space in the design.</p>
<h2>2.    Reversible Figure-Ground Relationship</h2>
<p>Both figure and the ground get equal attention in this type. In such design, there is space for the ground to take over the figure and for the figure to take over the ground. By doing so, it creates a sort of ambiguity.</p>
<h2>3.    Ambiguous Figure-Ground Relationship</h2>
<p>This type of relationship makes it quite difficult for spectators to separate ground from the figure in design. In such designs, viewers cannot detect a focal point. Although, it is ideal for creating patterns in the logo.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE THE CONCEPT IN DESIGNING</h2>
<p>So, if you want to create distinct figure ground relationships in the logo, here is what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create stark figure-ground distinction by using contrasting colors. Using warm colors against a cool and cool against a warm background you can create a compelling contrast. This is especially helpful for users to recognize and read the text.</li>
<li>Make the ground non-existent in your logo, so that figure in design dominates the ground. You need to amplify and prominent the figure elements so that the ground becomes insignificant.</li>
<li>A blurred background acts well against a text. It is another way to make the figure-ground relationship blatant. In fact, it is a key technique in filmmaking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>END OF THE LINE</h2>
<p>So, these are the things you should consider about <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">making your business logo according to the figure-ground relationship concept</a>.</p>

<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/02/27/8-effective-seo-tips-rank-beginner-website/">8 effective SEO tips to rank beginner website</a></p>
<h1>Identify your brand</h1>
<p>The logo is an explanation of your business that should be potent enough to communicate with the targeted audience. Therefore, it should possess all the elements of the business that are mandatory to be delivered to the audience. List the things about your brand and especially its ideology. Link your ideologies with symbols and elements that best convey your brand`s message and use these elements smartly to create a logo. Be precise, use hidden clues and follow ‘less is more strategy’.</p>
<h2>Color’s psyche</h2>
<p>Remember your brand’s logo is not just a small colorful image. In fact, it involves a whole psyche of colors behind each element. Color psyche is vital to know in <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">logo designing</a>.  Some shades of colors are considered as harsh while some are cool. According to the color theory, the red color is considered as energetic while the orange shade produces friendly or youthful vibes. Yellow is used for cheerfulness, and the green color is for instructional purposes. The blue tones are used in professional or medical product logo.  Purple is for spirituality, black demonstrates power, white reflects simplicity, whereas pink color is commonly used in toys or other babies’ stuff. So try to opt the most appropriate color as per your business nature and customers psyche.</p>
<h2>Timelessness</h2>
<p>Timelessness matters a lot. Because you’re crafting a logo that will stay for years. So, try to come up with a design that is productive enough to interact with the people of not only today but tomorrow. Study deeply about the social transformations; how choices are changing, what are the values of people and other social trends. While studying the present design trends, try to predict the upcoming trends and make your logo accordingly.</p>
<h2>Thorough Research</h2>
<p>Research is mandatory in every aspect of designing to get success, including <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/02/the-ultimate-guide-to-logo-design/">logo designing.</a> Even the brands with the big name have their separate research team that is responsible for brief market trends, social aspects, market drifts, risk factors, etc. They study audience, their preferences, brand’s competitors, company’s long-term goals and every single aspect of the business that helps logo to stand out from the others.</p>
<p>Most of the start-up companies do not possess separate research panels for designing a logo.Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn`t. But it would be nearly impossible for the logo to fail to grab attention if all the aspects were thoroughly-researched.</p>
<h2>Simplicity and minimalism</h2>
<p>Try to keep logo as simple as possible because your logo will be used everywhere – from site to pamphlets or even from shoes to clothes. The heavy ornamentations, large fonts, clashing colors schemes can ruin your logo.</p>
<p>Consider popular logo designs too, and see how the simplicity works. One of the best examples of simplicity is NIKE, we all know how famous the logo is and how simple it is. It is a perfect example of minimalism approach while creating a logo. On the other hand, complicated logo designs are less likely preferable because complex logos are tough to identify. They are less memorable and less appealing.</p>
<p>Lastly, remember your logo is your brand’s identification. Follow mentioned tips to make a killer logo.</p>
