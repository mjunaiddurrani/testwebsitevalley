<p>We all are aware of WhatsApp messenger. If we will say that WhatsApp is the most significant source for text and voice messages, then it wouldn’t be wrong. Over millions of people use WhatsApp daily to connect to their relatives and friends. They do voice calls, video calls, group video calls, and many more. It is the most secure communication app.</p>
<p>Many updates have been made to WhatsApp since it was introduced. It has a really funky and unique chats default wallpaper. The update that made people a little bit annoying when the update changed ‘WhatsApp status’ as ‘Bio’ and allow people to share their pictures under ‘Status’ tag. But later, the audience gets comfortable with it.</p>
<p>WhatsApp was first introduced in 2009, and as of now, it has a vast number of users that are almost 2.00 Billion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No need to mention that if you are running any business, you have to face new challenges to your business and customers. The common problems could be: lacking website traffic, lacking users’ interests, sales funnel deficit, and deprived lead conversion. It is sad to deal with such issues after spending much time, money and considerations to the business.</p>
<p>The good news is that the use of several marketing tactics can help you solve these problems across the board. With its flexibility helps you <a href="https://www.intechnic.com/blog/how-to-set-smart-business-goals-for-a-business-website/">make improvements and reach the goals that you have set earlier for your business</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dig more in-depth at the common business problems and how marketing can play a significant role in problem-solving.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/12/5-unsung-myths-marketing/">5 UNSUNG MYTHS ABOUT MARKETING</a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Content Marketing Campaign</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fresh, new, genuine content is like a fuel for your business. It can work to resolve many of the issues that your business is facing and presents you with a chance to position your business in the center of your target audience. If the content is compelling, interesting and on the recent topics, it can earn more attention. The user-centric is the only things which you cannot take as an optional. Write a genuine and fresh blog or web content relevant to your business. Make your content highly-relevant to your potential readers’ preferences. Understand their opinions and think about their likes and dislikes before writing any content. The headlines and titles get more attention and require more consideration.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Properly Optimized Web Content</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After preparing the content, get all your attention towards optimization. Proper optimization is a need. Incorporate relevant keywords into the content. Here, you cannot go recklessly. You have to be very wise and responsible about what keywords should be added on a content. For this, research thoroughly your audience about what word(s) they will use to search you on the search engine. Incorporate them into your content. However, do not use more than three or four keywords in one webpage. Exceed can be harmful, and even Google can penalize you for misusing keywords. So, be very careful.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Short and Long Tail Keywords</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This point is the extension of the second one, but I am writing this separately to emphasizing more. Keywords are king for any content, and the importance of them cannot be neglected. There are two types of keywords: Short-tail keywords and Long-tail Keywords. Short-tail keywords are search maxims with one word, whereas long-tail keywords are phrases with three-four words. Which type is more productive, is crucial to understand. According to SEO experts, the use of Long-tail keyword is more common, and so it should be incorporated into content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Social Media Network</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Having a social media presence helps you achieving more business recognition and customers</a>. In fact, social media is like a breeding ground which should be used wisely. Business owners, sometimes, lack users’ interests and find it difficult to get more conversion. Here in such situation, the platform helps you by providing you more recognition with the help of its 2.8 billion active users.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Email Marketing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With the technological advancement and social media presence, it seems like the use of email is decreasing. However, still, email marketing has its own importance when it comes to solving common problems your business face, such as sales funnel insufficiency and poor lead conversion. This type of marketing helps you a lot. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or ask sales or contributions, and is meant to build devotion, faith, or brand awareness. It is also crucial for building relationships with prospects, leads, and new customers as it gives you a chance to communicate directly to them and convince, in their inbox, at a time that is suitable for them.</p>
<p>Finally, I would say that one who knows even little about the marketing industry cannot refuse the significance of it. The industry is booming and getting more authority on each successive day. In fact, the future also seems more prosperous.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a single person living in this digital era can say ‘NO’ to the importance of Marketing. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">Marketing is compulsory for any business</a>. It is something through which you can make your product well-known in the eyes of the people. Not limited to this, the industry is developing on each successive day. Marketing can be referred as a breeding ground that has opened many doors of success not only for business but also for many folks. But, unfortunately, like many industries, this industry also become a prey of irrelevant myths. So, let’s check out some of the important myths of marketing:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/08/simple-introduction-custom-web-design/">A Simple Introduction To Custom Web Design</a></p>
<p>Myth #1: <strong>Customers Take Your Social Posts for granted</strong></p>
<p>It is not true. Customers read your social content and it also can convince and influence their purchasing decisions. The study reveals, “Nearly 70% of B2C companies and 40% of B2B companies have developed their customer base through social networking sites.” It doesn’t matter much what the social network is, any text, video, image, contest or coupon you publish will get countless eyeballs in this breeding ground with 2.2 billion users.</p>
<p>Myth #2: <strong>Marketing Should Define Future Products&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>It is believed that marketing group allegedly has a grip on what consumers want or prefer in a product or services, as characterized by a list of &#8220;market requirements.&#8221;  Though, in many cases, the marketing group doesn&#8217;t know much about customers’ requirements because of the communication gap. Most of the vendors only know about their current accounts think they want in the future.</p>
<p>Myth #3: <strong>Social media Heals Reputation Wounds</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/how-to-market-a-product">Marketing is all about promoting products to make sales</a>. Not taking care about website feedback is not helpful here. Receiving that outraged Rip-off Report is enough to put an end to your business reputation in search engine results. Each word you say matters a lot and cannot be taken back. In case of any problem, make sure that your social media pages possess active administrators authorized to alleviate any problem immediately, individually and systematically. Well, this myth is true at some extent.</p>
<p>Myth #4: <strong>No need to evaluate social success By Communal Interactions</strong></p>
<p>Sales opportunities or profits should measure the ultimate success you get through social interactions. Interactions may also help you with sales opportunities; but, if you don’t close any of those leads, the campaign will be nothing but a disappointment, regardless of how many interactions were bred. Marketing is about drive higher sales in which evaluation is essential to know which strategy is functional.</p>
<p>Myth #5: <strong>Marketing Costs Nothing</strong></p>
<p>The marketing industry is booming on each successive day. The scope and the benefits your business will get are countless. With such broader scope, the industry plays a vital role in creating employment and also fruitful socio-economic progress. Though the use of social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube are all free to use, hidden costs always exist when applying a social media marketing campaign for most customer boost.</p>
<p>For an active and fetching social media promotion, you need an expert who prioritizes and implements the plan, be able to message, and monitors the mediums for customer response. And it is apparent that he will charge heavy bucks for this job.</p>

<h1>Twitter</h1>

The 140 characters count of a tweet might be limited, but if it’s being used wisely, then it will payback you more than your thoughts.

<p><strong><em>So, here are some tips:</em></strong></p>
<p>Tip #1: Check out each channel, study them and find out the channel which will work more effectively for your business. Try to consider some of the factors with each channel: The product or service you are offering and the available resources at your disposal. Social media is free, but your time is precious enough to care.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Don’t use every channel or sign up on every platform for just because they’re new in the market or getting popular on the souk. Instead, find out the channel which is most relevant, effective to the business you’ve chosen to appeal your customers.</p>

<p>In the past few years, live streaming is becoming more common. In fact, interacting with the fans can multiply a level of trustworthiness and authenticity to your social media marketing.

This community with over 500 million users has made their live video broadcasting feature available for people. Instagram Livestreaming seems quite similar to Facebook live stream, but there’s some difference– the primary difference is that Instagram videos cannot be stored anywhere, meaning your viewers can only watch when you’re genuinely live. Use Instagram’s live video broadcasting and get creative with it and see how your followers respond! Post consistently</p>
<h2>Post Consistently on YouTube</h2>
<p>Give your viewers an enticement to subscribe to your YouTube channel with the guarantee of a constant strain of high-value content.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently, there are more than two billion users on Facebook. On the other hand, Instagram has around 800 million monthly users. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">With a ranking of such high-value social audiences on these two platforms</a>, you have better chance to find out your desired audience. In fact, today you can see many influencer marketing campaigns accomplished by multiple brands on these platforms &#8212; most of them are successful, fortunately.</p>
<p>Discovering the right influencers on social networks is a great start, but it isn’t the something that acts as a magical weapon. You have to build on or simplify your influencer interactions to guarantee that your campaigns drive brand awareness and ultimately improving your bottom line.</p>
<p>So, here are some indications that your social influencer campaign isn’t working as it ought to be:</p>

<h1>1.    Your Influencer Content Isn’t Reaching Their Viewers</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, Organic reach is falling. If we talk about Facebook, it dropped by 50% during the last year. It is alarming. By this means, your influencer’s content is not reaching to their viewers. In fact, the Instagram influencer’s post can only be view by around 20% of their spectators.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is not the fault of your influencers. They generate valuable content that resonates with the spectators. Our so-called Social media platform is not a “pay to play” thing. The good news is the pay element is a whole lot inexpensive than initiating more influencers.</p>
<p>Think or study how you’re giving support to your influencers. Are you just giving a note to your influencers with the message? Unfortunately, that isn’t enough to do. Instead, generate and share materials that’ll benefit your influencers get a better perceptive of your product. And go crazy with your creativeness.</p>
<h1>2.    Sales or Coupons Are the Only Motivation for Your Audience to Visit</h1>
<p>A long message, like one-time-use coupon or voucher, makes it stress-free for you to generate leads but this will stop coming in once the elevation finishes. Contrariwise, the magnificence of influencers is their ability to associate longstanding.  In fact, discount or a new coupon can weaken your trustworthiness, if they’re being offered every week. Instead, your primary goal should be getting a reliable engagement.</p>
<h1>3.    If Your Current Influencers Are Stopped Delivering</h1>
<p>Influencers, just like the brand or products, have a life cycle, too, it is a tough time for you &#8212; if your influencers aren’t generating the numbers which they used to breed. For such circumstances, pay consideration to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evolution of their niche</li>
<li>Variations in engagement trends</li>
<li>Saturation of their audience</li>
<li>More sponsorships</li>
</ul>
<h1>4.    Your Influencer’s Other Posts Aren’t Appropriate</h1>
<p>It is not something beneficial to think or expect relevancy from your influencers about your product. On the other hand, if your influencer posts about the products feel inappropriate compared to every other piece of their content, it indeed is.</p>
<p>To find the appropriate influencers fit your slot, keep an eye on the following tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out some great influencers who’re excellent at their work. <a href="http://thecoffeedate.com/blog/how-to-collab-on-instagram">Follow them and use Facebook or Instagram proposals to discover some more influencers.</a></li>
<li>Always good to study the competitors’ influencers. By studying them, you get many things more to know.</li>
<li>Be more particular and target the influencers who focus on a specific niche.</li>
<li>Make sure your message matches the influencers.</li>
<li>Get more details through Instagram user-endpoint API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, I would say, try something unique and don’t give up!</p>

<h2>Determine your Goals and Objectives</h2>

<h2>Add Compelling Headlines</h2>
<p>Headlines matter and work significantly in changing the way we think about the content. As most of the readers skim headlines and irrelevant headlines lead you off course. Write headlines first and ask yourself about if they conclude the story if it engages the readers and all. You can also conduct A/B testing to know which headline works more in engaging users.</p>
<p>As Felix Salmon suggests “Even with the most appealing headlines in the world, for every individual who clicks on it, there are hundreds, if not thousands, who see it, absorb it, and simply move on. People get their news from headlines now in a way they never did before.”</p>
<h2>Be Who You Are</h2>
<p>Don’t astray your followers by portraying yourself as a fake personality on social media. Be who you are. Be genuine and reflect your authenticity to the posts.</p>

<p>No matter how good your post is, timing matters. If your post is for the right readers and on the right time only then you’ll see results. Schedule your post at the best times without making assumptions. Start with targeting your audience, know them, consider their location, use the right scheduling tools, maintain consistency on posts, continue to test, and keep an eye on the competitors.</p>
<p>So these are six steps to market yourself in social media.</p>
