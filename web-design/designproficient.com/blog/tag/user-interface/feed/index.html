<ul>
<li><strong>Bold Typography</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This year and even earlier, thick fonts and flexible typefaces are in the trend which is going to outshine even in the future. Professional websites with bold typography attract or grab more eye-balls of the audience than the regular sites. Experimentation with the different contrast of fonts can deliver a sense of hierarchy and space, helps you make better UI design and so to attract more customers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use of Bright Colors</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Colors are always important when it comes to website design. Wrong color choice can make design poor and deliver lousy impression to the spectators. It is a year of bright, optimistic, lively and dynamic colors. Know about the psychology works behind each color. Not every color is suitable for your website design or customers. Some colors are provocative, some are soothing, and some are alienating. Research thoroughly and choose the best one.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adding Micro Interaction to the Design</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What is micro-interaction? It is a little animation or less visual responses users see when they are going to perform any particular action. Trigger, Rules, Feedback, and Loops &amp; Modes are the essential elements of micro-interaction. Micro-interactions can guide people how to use the interface, helps you know on which device users are in, enhance the UX, and have an overall psychological impact on users. A good micro-interaction stand-up in the overall design of the website interface and keep users engaged without distracting them at any point.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Content Strategy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Videos content strategy is a king among other <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">marketing strategies that help your website to rank better in a search engine results</a>. Adding compelling videos to a site make your website powerful enough to grab more customers. No doubt, videos can improve SEO, use for stronger consumer attention, the key to high engagement, and the most powerful way to evoke emotions of your customers online. In recent several years, videos have gained significant popularity, and 2018 will see more of video-based content coming up with live video options to convey information and feelings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporating Animation to the Website</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is your website static? Is your site boring without any animation? If, yes, then this trend is worth to look and follow. Incorporating attractive and <a href="https://www.commonplaces.com/blog/4-top-web-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2018">responsive animation can make your site more eye-grabbing and engaging</a>. From small waterproof effects to stunning video backdrops, you can do many things and take your site to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>LAST THOUGHT</strong></p>
<p>When all is said and done, I’ll suggest you keep yourself up-to-date and an eye out for such trends when you’re going to design an interface of your website or app. The practice will ensure that your design is fresh.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people landing on your website, they do not spend more than five seconds to decide whether to move further or not. Therefore, investing in UX is considered as necessary to gain trust, brand recognition and guarantee user preservation.</p>
<p>For respective purpose you have to follow several technique, some of which I’ve mentioned bellow</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/26/5-amazing-ways-optimize-custom-website-lead-generation/">5 AMAZING WAYS TO OPTIMIZE YOUR CUSTOM WEBSITE FOR LEAD GENERATION</a></p>
<h1>UNIFORM DESIGN</h1>
<p>Once you have decided the design of your application or website, stick on it until the end. Make sure the design you have picked must possess consistency and uniformity. The user should be not get confused in website, whether it is about typography, color or anything. The bold typography with compelling color get more eyeballs and the thing which make them more attracted is consistency. It is your task to be consistent with the aesthetics and construction throughout the development of the app.</p>
<h2>VISUAL HIERARCHY OF CONTENTS</h2>
<p>With uniformity and consistency, also maintain hierarchy or balance in visual contents. The design of the text and icons without including empty spaces inside should be your first option. Maintaining the visual hierarchy is important as it delivers users comfortable experience of readability.</p>
<h2>PERSONALIZE THE UX</h2>
<p>Personalization is when the behavior of past visits is recorded by an app, and stored for retargeting determinations. If a user has specific buying patterns, you can provide them with proposals and deals to assist them with their purchasing decisions. Personalization offers more unique and relevant user experience. The more aligned the experience is with a user’s requirements and inclinations, the <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/App-Design-and-Development">more likely they are to continue to use the application.</a></p>
<h2>OFFER ASSISTANCE</h2>
<p>Offer your users assistance within the app by providing different support options. Users will often search for help in the toolbar or tab bar of an app. Offer multiple ways for users to receive support, including self-serve FAQs and live support through click-to-call buttons.</p>
<h2> QUALITATIVE DATA</h2>
<p>So, you are working really hard on your design and want to examine the effectiveness of your efforts. For that traditional and free analytics are should not be your choice. I will tell you both qualitative and quantitative data are equally important in order to fully grasp your UX and pinpoint opportunities for optimization. Qualitative data allow you to visualize what is actually going on inside your app and how your user behaviors. This way you can improve user experience.</p>
<h2>TRANSPARENCY TO SHARING OPTIONS</h2>
<p>Today, many of are more comfortable of sharing personal <a href="https://www.hswsolutions.com/services/mobile-web-development/mobile-website-vs-apps/">information on devices such as mobile and within apps</a>. It increased concerns about how that data is kept, shared and used.</p>
<p>So, to establish more trustworthy relationship with your users, explain precisely what they’re sharing and with whom. No users want their private content shared on social networks without their awareness or consents, and if that occurs, you’ll not just lose trust, you’re probably also getting a negative review, which has additional downstream effects.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a fashion app or website, do not dare to assume that people on your app will robotically want to share their styling ideas or progress with their Facebook or LinkedIn community. Instead, make sure to offer a variety of sharing choices for your users that they can switch on and off at-will.</p>
<p>So, these are some of techniques you must use to make your users feel like they’re in a right place when they come to your website.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things like: death, taxes, and a question from people asking ‘So what do you do for a living’ are constant. But some things are not. Like, to give a suitable answer about how it should be a UX designer can be muddling even for many custom product designers.</p>
<p>I have seen so many people dealing with lots of problems in nailing down the answer of how to be a UX designer?</p>
<p>This is what I got from an expert:</p>
<p>“To be a UX designer, it is just like to be inside your users’ brain, to perceive design from the user’s perspective and to resolve expected confusions of users.”</p>
<p>It is like a never-ending route that requires keeping user experience prior more than anything. Though it is challenging to feel like a user, it is not impossible.</p>
<p>To guide your product design and make it bloom, I’ve collected several essential UX principles:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/28/5-unexpected-social-media-marketing-trends-professional-social-media-services2018/">5 Unexpected Social Media Marketing Trends in professional social media services2018</a></p>
<h1>Product Design Should Be Digestible:</h1>
<p>It would be easy to absorb or digest the product if it is simple and fulfils all the demands of users. You don’t need to spend lots of time or energy to see what things work. Consider all the things that help your product to make it the bottom of the funnel and opt the best one.</p>
<p>Design should be readable and easy to use to make users decide what to do. Users need proper guidelines, and you can do so by maintaining hierarchy and consistency in typography.</p>
<h1>Should Have Clarity:</h1>
<p>Beside things mentioned above, clarity is another thing that adds value to your product. One has to be very clear about his/her product.</p>
<p>With clarity in design, I mean to be very clear about product’s pricing. If users find any difficulty in figuring the price of a product, they’ll probably not buy that product. Therefore, it is important to mention price with ‘buy now’ ticker for better UX.</p>
<p>Making things as clear as possible should be your goal.</p>
<h1>Should Build Trust:</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">It is easy to trust if the design is good.</a> With honesty and clarity in explaining product’s features, one can build trust and increase conversions.</p>
<p>Consider Uber and its stress-free ride service. It is highly successful brand and a perfect example of building trust with consumers.</p>
<h1>Should Possess Familiarity:</h1>
<p>It is good if your product design is ground-breaking, but it should convert better. <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/10-ux-design-predictions-for-2018/">Offering entirely new framework and layout can be a UX killer.</a></p>
<p>Consider all the famous frameworks and layouts. Pay careful attention to each detail and use familiar patterns in your product to give it a native look.</p>
<h1>Should Be User-centric</h1>
<p>Being a product designer, you should have to build a thoughtful product with clear insight and intentions. The respective behavior towards product shows that you care about your users. It is also important as more than 60% of users give up your product just because they think you don’t care about them.</p>
<h1>WRAPPING IT UP</h1>
<p>It is quite easy to make the product as according to the UX canons. All you have to do is be very honest with yourself and perform each action from users’ perspective.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>User Interface (UI) Defined:</strong></p>
<p>In the language of computing, User Interface (UI) is all what is incorporated into an electronically &amp; digitally operated device for an individual to interact with at all levels seamlessly. The User Interface comprises of input channels such as keyboard, keypad, mouse &amp; soft-keys while display screens and desktop appearance account for the output channels. Expressing it in different terms, it may be regarded as a means of creating interaction between the user and a <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website </a>or mobile application.</p>
<p><strong>Significance Attached to User Interface (UI) Designing:</strong></p>
<p>Owing to ever-increasing dependence on web applications/software &amp; mobile applications, a major chunk of organizations on global scale, as we know of today, have been obligated into setting User Interface as their top priority, in an attempt to improve and provide optimum user experience. Consequently, agencies responsible for developing User Interface of varied types are spending hefty amounts on their Research &amp; Development departments with the intention of coming up with interfaces designed such a way that prove to be an absolute delight to their users. In order that maximum utility levels are achieved by users coupled with the all-time experience of swift computing &amp; smart mobility, with the consumers falling under any age, class, territory, gender or qualification criteria. In the race against user-friendliness, the developers of User Interface are loading new &amp; crisp features into their designing with each passing day.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/08/24/custom-web-design-best-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Custom Web Design Is The Best Choice For Your Business</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>User Experience (UX) Defined:</strong></p>
<p>User Experience (UX), a term used in conjugation with its parent term, User Interface (UI), is referred to as the outcome a consumer undergoes while getting hands-on with digital tools &amp; devices. The User Experience can best be calibrated via following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The display &amp; desktop appearance of the device, catching the user’s eye at the first go</li>
<li>The response time with which the user switches and swaps in between apps, enabling simultaneous operations &amp; multitasking</li>
<li>The overall content accompanying all computer software &amp; mobile applications, aiding users in a step-by-step mode</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance Attached to Correlation Between User Interface (UI) &amp; User Experience (UX):</strong></p>
<p>What they say appears to be quite true that the simpler it is, the better it is. Evaluating with the perspective of a user, the need for designing &amp; crafting user-friendly interface running on sophisticated backend systems can well be understood. Meeting and keeping up to the consumers’ demands &amp; expectations is what User Experience encompasses. After all, it does make sense that such exorbitant investments put into its research &amp; development are able to pay off dividends only when it is embraced by the masses instantly. With so many choices lined up before the consumers, they would certainly not let be done away with their right to choose. Feedbacks with regards to the User Interface (UI) go a long way in fetching modifications &amp; advancements that spur the user experience into a pleasant and gratifying arena. It is quite understandable that a simpler, smarter interface equates well with better earnings, greater savings &amp; a stable goodwill.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding a designer to work on a specific project seems significantly easy these days. If you know your basics around photoshop and illustrator, chances are you’ll get tons of clients without a problem. However, if you don’t know the essentials to a specific design type, chances are your designs won’t really work for your client. Web UI belongs to a similar class.</p>
<h1><strong>Understanding Web UI</strong></h1>
<p>The user interface for Web Design isn’t as simple as designer a header, a footer, a few sliders and folds in between. The trajectory of Web UI differs from brand to brand. Consider Web UI similar to an ideology.  Your design portrays what your company stands for and that’s why your focus needs to be immense. As a graphic designer, you need to put your heart and soul into designing a web UI that’s near perfection for the brand you’re working on. In this blog, we’ll be assisting you in creating the best Web UI that you can possibly find.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/07/20/3-awesome-tips-tricks-perfect-typography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typerfect – 3 Awesome Tips and tricks for perfect typography</a></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Focus on the blend between Web UI and UX</strong></h2>
<p>One thing that you need to understand is that good UX is directly proportional to good UI. That’s literally the one statement that can drift you towards success in no time. The user interface needs to go hand in hand with the user experience. From the click of a button to the complete scrolling order on the website, user experience accounts to everything.</p>
<h2><strong>Understand Your Target Market</strong></h2>
<p>Your target market is the industry that you’re targeting to achieve ROI. While some might feel that the target market is important solely for marketing purposes, they’re mistaken. Consider how your targeted audience would react to the design you’ve made. A minimalistic design full of aesthetics might be great for a targeted audience of youngsters and teenagers that are creative; but hey, maybe not for an audience of a mean age between 30 to 40. So, what good is an aesthetic design when your audience doesn’t understand it? Exactly the point.</p>
<h2><strong>Design Consistency Is Key</strong></h2>
<p>Design is nothing but concept and concepts don’t change halfway into the design. This is exactly why Web UI consistency is important as well. From the color tone to the aesthetics being used. Every element being used in the design is essential to the concept one of the many reasons why you need to keep it consistent throughout the design.</p>
<p>All in all, Web UI is important for an ROI that your business targets. At The Web Founders, we take care of Web UI very carefully. Want our experienced web design and development professionals to work on your project? Reach us today and discuss your project.</p>
