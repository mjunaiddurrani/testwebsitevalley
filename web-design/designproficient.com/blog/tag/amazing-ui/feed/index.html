				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us spend more than two hours online every day using different devices with screens that require near exclusive attention where more than trillion websites and the same quantity of mobile apps are battling for our valuable time and attention. To make sure you achieve maximum attention of people in your website or app, The Web Founders has selected some crucial tactics or advices to make you stand out from the rest with your exceptional interface.</p>
<p>So, let’s drive&#8230;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>1.    BE CAREFUL WITH NEW UI PATTERNS</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/design/10-quick-tips-for-uiux-design/">Do not make your audience to think too hard about the interface elements</a>. Most of the elements are already known to users. By this I meant, CTA should look like CTA, Links should look like links and so on.</p>
<p>There is no need to get too creative with common patterns or designs. It might sound exciting to do something out of the box or unique with them, but that does not mean usable. Usability and creativity need to be well-adjusted.</p>
<h1>2.    BE CAREFUL ABOUT SIMPLICITY</h1>
<p>It takes no longer than five seconds for users to judge your website, or whether they’re interested or not, so just be careful about what you want users to do on your site. Consider things that help you to make it easy to use. For the respective purpose, prefer consistent design, it is more straightforward or familiar for visitors because it reprocesses constituents, shades, and aesthetic to lessen the requirement for visitors to rethink.</p>
<h1>3.    BE DIRECT AND STAY HONEST</h1>
<p>By staying honest with yourself and visitors, you can convey your message with confidence. Honesty with a user works more than your thinking. So, for this purpose consider social proof instead of just talking about potentials. Nothing will upsurge your conversion as utterly as being honest with the customers.</p>
<h1>4.    COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CUSTOMERS</h1>
<p>Knowing who your users are, is crucial to make the interface most comfortable for them. For this, you have to select the audience relevant to your business. For example, if your website is about stylish chic outfits for women, choose women who want to wear such modern clothes. After targeting the audience, research on them to know their preferences and desires.</p>
<h1>5.    THINK HOW USERS WILL USE YOUR INTERFACE</h1>
<p>Before designing interface, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">you need to see how visitors will use your website or interface.</a> People landing on your site use it in two ways:</p>
<p>Directly: interacting with the elements of the product.</p>
<p>Indirectly: interacting with an element external to the product.</p>
<h2>Instances of direct interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Taking a card</li>
<li>Tapping a button</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping an item with a fingertip</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instances of indirect interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using key commands and shortcuts</li>
<li>Indicating and clicking with a mouse</li>
<li>Drawing on a Wacom tablet</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>6.    SET EXPECTATIONS</h1>
<p>Most of the interactions – directly or indirectly – have some consequences and sometimes, also anxiety. But, you can eliminate this anxiety of users by allowing your users know what will happen just after clicking that particular button before they do it. You can do this through thoughtful design. Highlight the CTA button with appropriate color that has strong meaning. Like we all know green is for a ‘go’ and red for ‘stop.’ You can also use widely understood symbols in a blend with the copy.</p>
<h1>7.    GIVE RESPONSE—FAST</h1>
<p>We are living in a world where environment gives us feedback or respond to our every action. Do you remember to know the stimulus and response theory? The theory implicates here &#8212; We speak, and others respond, or they speak, we respond.</p>
<p>When it comes to your website make sure it all happens quick. Any delay over 2-second mark as an interruption and more than that is enough to cause a bounce. So make your site fast and remove all unnecessary barriers for your users.</p>
<h1>8.    RECOGNITION TO RECALL</h1>
<p>This principle is psychological, suggests, if you have many choices, it is not that hard for you to recognize something already known. Recognition principle should be used wisely to make an experience more comfortable for users. The challenge with recognition is to give users familiar elements which they have been exposed to earlier, instead of expecting them to have a creative idea.</p>
<h1>END OF THE LINE</h1>
<p>So, these are some of tips we have gathered from different sources and experts. Hopefully, they will work for your website..</p>
