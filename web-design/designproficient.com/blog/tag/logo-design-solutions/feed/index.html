It is simple, easy to understand, easy to recall, and one of the best examples of ‘Less is more’ approach. We can find a number of designs just like Nike who are known for their unique design. Some have incorporated minimal principle, and some are the exemplification of maximalism principle.

But, that needs a lot of struggle, consideration, and witty approach. Don’t worry, I have taken some of the most important tips out from the experts for you. So, without any further ado. Go ahead:</p>

<h1><strong>1.  </strong><strong>Go With Plan </strong></h1>
<p>Always go with planning. Pre-planned things are more likely to succeed than unplanned things. Make sure you are planning each thing properly. How your logo should be, what customers will be its targeting, what message it will convey, how flexible it should be, and there are countless things need to be planned.</p>
<h2><strong>2.  </strong><strong>Don’t Fall For Premade Custom Logos, Hire an Expert</strong></h2>
<p>That’s completely fine if you know not much about logo designing since you are an entrepreneur, not a designer. There’s always a good alternative. Hire an expert designer who knows basic to advance principles of designs, color psychology, and possesses years of experience in the reputable organization.</p>
<p>Commonly, many people have been seen going for a premade logos. Premade or ready-made logos are not appropriate for your business. They are not unique and so should not be used.</p>
<h2><strong>3.  </strong><strong>Don’t Complicate, Make It Simple</strong></h2>
<p>Things if not simple, will sucks – to you and to your customers who are speculating on your logo and have lots of expectations from you. It is not good in any way to make them angry and confused. In fact, the purpose of the logo is to convey brand’s message. If they are multifaceted, they will not serve their primary goal.</p>
<h2><strong>4.  </strong><strong>Avoid Unnecessariness, Incorporate Only Needed Things</strong></h2>
<p>This point is an extension of them &#8211;. With simplicity, it meant to incorporate only things your logo needs or you think essential to add. Take a paper and pen out. Write about your business—what your business is about, who your customers are, what they do, and all. Write five two-three lines on each and then summarize. Hand over this summary to your designer and ask him to incorporate them as much as possible. Heavy ornaments, loud color tones, excessive text are the things can make your design meager.</p>
<h2><strong>5.  </strong><strong>Get Some Inspiration</strong></h2>
<p>The present market is overflowing with a number of good-to-inspire logo designs. Why not take some inspiration and take a hold of the good things from them? Research the market, get some good logo designs to see, study them and take inspiration for your coming business logo. By inspiration, it doesn’t mean to steal their work.</p>
<h2><strong><u>Last Thought</u></strong></h2>
<p>The logo is crucial for your business. Make it stand out and noticeable. Make your business well-known in the eyes of the public and get more sales. Directly or indirectly, it all starts with your logo, so don’t compromise with its eminence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever laid your eyes on a logo that’s just plain bad? I bet you have. It seems like a terrible thing to say, but it’s a fact that the increase in bad logo designs are increasing. Laymen or design professionals, no matter who you are, some logos are just too hard to like. Some people actually consider a bad logo to be a reflection of ‘brand weakness’. Believe it or not, these ‘people’ happen to be some of the best design professionals in the world.</p>
<p>So, if you’re a logo designer or maybe a logo design company that designed a bad logo, does that make you a bad design professional/agency? The answer is no. Even the best of us make mistakes. However, these mistakes come back to haunt you heavily when the time comes. Why wait for a career suicide when you can work on the red flags and turn them green?</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’ll be discussing some of the most prominent mistakes that logo designers make frequently. So without running around in circles, let’s jump right into it.</p>
<h2><strong>A Very Busy Logo Design</strong></h2>
<p>This is perhaps one of the biggest mistakes that I’ve seen over the years. In fact, I’ve seen esteemed experts in the design industry such as Jason Li, Co-Founder of Tum Yum DeSignagency discuss this problem in the past as well. You can have a look at his blog <a href="https://medium.com/tomyum/logo-design-af5080273895">here</a>.</p>

<p>A busy logo is always going to get a bad impression from the targeted audience. If there’s too much going on in the logo design, your potential custom won’t know where to pay attention. One of the many reasons why minimal design is progressing in general. There’s always one ‘sweet spot’ in your logo that really is key in creating results. When there’s too much happening in the logo, you won’t really get the chance to impress your customer. Of course, elements are important to your logo, but make sure the design in the perfect flow. Focus on not overcrowding the logo with unnecessary elements. In most cases, one single element is enough to do the trick.</p>

<h2><strong>Poor Focus on Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>This mistake is one of the most repetitive mistakes that I’ve seen happen. This even happens to the biggest of brands. As a logo designer and/or as a logo deSignagency, you need to realize that the logo isn’t solely visible on one placement. From social media display pictures to business cards, the brand identity needs to customize itself. A huge part of the brand identity is the logo design itself and that’s where things get rough.</p>

<p>Thorough research on the logo design placements is very important. As a design professional, you need to have a list of placements lined up to offer the client. You can also include this as a question in your design brief. Most of the times, clients aren’t well aware of brand identity. As a logo design professional, it is your duty to not only educate the client but assist them as well.</p>
<h2><strong>A Victim to Cliché </strong></h2>
<p>Now, this is one mistake that sometimes rattles up a lot of logo designers and even logo design companies. From the sparks, to the bevels and even the swooshes, there are several cliché design trends that are overused in the industry.</p>

<p>What confuses graphic designers around the world is that at one hand people endorse design trends and at the other, hate them in general. Well, it’s simple. There are several areas where design trends actually work. Logo Design isn’t one of them. A notable example is Material Design that is being followed by designers worldwide for app and web design. On the contrary, it can’t be used in the field of logo design. Logos define individuality and if there’s even a small similarity between two logos, the logo isn’t worth it.
