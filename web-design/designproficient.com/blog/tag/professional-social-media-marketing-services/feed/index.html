<p>We all are aware of WhatsApp messenger. If we will say that WhatsApp is the most significant source for text and voice messages, then it wouldn’t be wrong. Over millions of people use WhatsApp daily to connect to their relatives and friends. They do voice calls, video calls, group video calls, and many more. It is the most secure communication app.</p>
<p>Many updates have been made to WhatsApp since it was introduced. It has a really funky and unique chats default wallpaper. The update that made people a little bit annoying when the update changed ‘WhatsApp status’ as ‘Bio’ and allow people to share their pictures under ‘Status’ tag. But later, the audience gets comfortable with it.</p>
<p>WhatsApp was first introduced in 2009, and as of now, it has a vast number of users that are almost 2.00 Billion.</p>

<h1>Determine the Company’s Marketing Goals</h1>
<p>Even though this might sound a little cliché, but it is advised that you “Plan your work, and work your plan.” Developing a strategic plan is going to help your organization go a long way towards getting off to a very good start. When you are determining the marketing goals, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What new products and/or services will I be launching this year?</li>
<li>What is the overall revenue goal for this year?</li>
<li>What key metrics are extremely important when it comes to measuring my sales and marketing success?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Reduce Your Expenses</h1>
<p>One of the tried and tested ways using which you can bring up your sales is by reducing your expenses. For examples, you may want to consider having shared offices instead of having your own expansive and expensive space. Keep a track of your account books and identify where your money is going. After analyzing this, look for various different ways to reduce all the expenses incurred without actually compromising the business.</p>
<h1>Improve Your Customer Relationship</h1>
<p>You should also be active when it comes to improving your relationship with your clients. Focus on initiating loyalty. When consumers are loyal, you can trust that they will support your products, even when you increase prices, given that the quality remains top-notch. Research about your clients, think about customer segmentation, learn about what they need, and design approaches that will allow you to deliver a high level of consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is very easy to be overwhelmed when it comes to considering all the various different marketing choices and paths accessible to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">grow your business</a>. Nonetheless, with all signs pointing towards constant economic growth worldwide in the year 2018, there is still time to create a plan to increase revenue this year.</p>

It is important to bear in mind your website is depicted to search engines and must have to communicate your website’s purpose accurately. Try to optimize your website and permit search engine to know when to show your site in the results for appropriate search queries.</p>

Content should always reflect your keyword strategy. Content is a great place to highlight the relevant keywords in a natural, harmonious way and to support search engines make the connection between the keywords and your website that you have incorporated in it.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The importance of customers in business progress is undeniable. Earning their trust is essential to get that mark you always dream of. In chasing this dream, you have to give them the thing they want more from you: Social validation. I have seen numerous web pages and blog posts ranking well due to the social validation. This can be attained by trial and error method and lots of consideration. For business ranging from small to medium-sized business, the only way you can get social validation is by the quality and unique content writing.</p>
<p><strong>So, How To Write A Unique And Appealing Content?</strong></p>
<p>Here are few guidelines to incorporate in your writing style:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never steal a word from other resource. Stay away from plagiarism by citing research and using your own words to explain the topic.</li>
<li>Do not stick on one resource. Better to use multiple sources when researching.</li>
<li>Give your text a unique structure.</li>
<li>Incorporate your individual style.</li>
<li>Keep reliance on your rational thinking. Explain things how you comprehend them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>LAST THOUGHT</u></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">When your content is high in quality</a>, it delivers value. When your content provides people with what they are on the lookout for, they lean towards to engage with your content through numerous means. And this is how your content will earn it&#8217;s acknowledged and helps your website raise in search engine results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No need to mention that if you are running any business, you have to face new challenges to your business and customers. The common problems could be: lacking website traffic, lacking users’ interests, sales funnel deficit, and deprived lead conversion. It is sad to deal with such issues after spending much time, money and considerations to the business.</p>
<p>The good news is that the use of several marketing tactics can help you solve these problems across the board. With its flexibility helps you <a href="https://www.intechnic.com/blog/how-to-set-smart-business-goals-for-a-business-website/">make improvements and reach the goals that you have set earlier for your business</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dig more in-depth at the common business problems and how marketing can play a significant role in problem-solving.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/12/5-unsung-myths-marketing/">5 UNSUNG MYTHS ABOUT MARKETING</a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Content Marketing Campaign</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fresh, new, genuine content is like a fuel for your business. It can work to resolve many of the issues that your business is facing and presents you with a chance to position your business in the center of your target audience. If the content is compelling, interesting and on the recent topics, it can earn more attention. The user-centric is the only things which you cannot take as an optional. Write a genuine and fresh blog or web content relevant to your business. Make your content highly-relevant to your potential readers’ preferences. Understand their opinions and think about their likes and dislikes before writing any content. The headlines and titles get more attention and require more consideration.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Properly Optimized Web Content</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After preparing the content, get all your attention towards optimization. Proper optimization is a need. Incorporate relevant keywords into the content. Here, you cannot go recklessly. You have to be very wise and responsible about what keywords should be added on a content. For this, research thoroughly your audience about what word(s) they will use to search you on the search engine. Incorporate them into your content. However, do not use more than three or four keywords in one webpage. Exceed can be harmful, and even Google can penalize you for misusing keywords. So, be very careful.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Short and Long Tail Keywords</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This point is the extension of the second one, but I am writing this separately to emphasizing more. Keywords are king for any content, and the importance of them cannot be neglected. There are two types of keywords: Short-tail keywords and Long-tail Keywords. Short-tail keywords are search maxims with one word, whereas long-tail keywords are phrases with three-four words. Which type is more productive, is crucial to understand. According to SEO experts, the use of Long-tail keyword is more common, and so it should be incorporated into content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Social Media Network</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Having a social media presence helps you achieving more business recognition and customers</a>. In fact, social media is like a breeding ground which should be used wisely. Business owners, sometimes, lack users’ interests and find it difficult to get more conversion. Here in such situation, the platform helps you by providing you more recognition with the help of its 2.8 billion active users.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Email Marketing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With the technological advancement and social media presence, it seems like the use of email is decreasing. However, still, email marketing has its own importance when it comes to solving common problems your business face, such as sales funnel insufficiency and poor lead conversion. This type of marketing helps you a lot. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or ask sales or contributions, and is meant to build devotion, faith, or brand awareness. It is also crucial for building relationships with prospects, leads, and new customers as it gives you a chance to communicate directly to them and convince, in their inbox, at a time that is suitable for them.</p>
<p>Finally, I would say that one who knows even little about the marketing industry cannot refuse the significance of it. The industry is booming and getting more authority on each successive day. In fact, the future also seems more prosperous.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a single person living in this digital era can say ‘NO’ to the importance of Marketing. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">Marketing is compulsory for any business</a>. It is something through which you can make your product well-known in the eyes of the people. Not limited to this, the industry is developing on each successive day. Marketing can be referred as a breeding ground that has opened many doors of success not only for business but also for many folks. But, unfortunately, like many industries, this industry also become a prey of irrelevant myths. So, let’s check out some of the important myths of marketing:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/08/simple-introduction-custom-web-design/">A Simple Introduction To Custom Web Design</a></p>
<p>Myth #1: <strong>Customers Take Your Social Posts for granted</strong></p>
<p>It is not true. Customers read your social content and it also can convince and influence their purchasing decisions. The study reveals, “Nearly 70% of B2C companies and 40% of B2B companies have developed their customer base through social networking sites.” It doesn’t matter much what the social network is, any text, video, image, contest or coupon you publish will get countless eyeballs in this breeding ground with 2.2 billion users.</p>
<p>Myth #2: <strong>Marketing Should Define Future Products&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>It is believed that marketing group allegedly has a grip on what consumers want or prefer in a product or services, as characterized by a list of &#8220;market requirements.&#8221;  Though, in many cases, the marketing group doesn&#8217;t know much about customers’ requirements because of the communication gap. Most of the vendors only know about their current accounts think they want in the future.</p>
<p>Myth #3: <strong>Social media Heals Reputation Wounds</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/how-to-market-a-product">Marketing is all about promoting products to make sales</a>. Not taking care about website feedback is not helpful here. Receiving that outraged Rip-off Report is enough to put an end to your business reputation in search engine results. Each word you say matters a lot and cannot be taken back. In case of any problem, make sure that your social media pages possess active administrators authorized to alleviate any problem immediately, individually and systematically. Well, this myth is true at some extent.</p>
<p>Myth #4: <strong>No need to evaluate social success By Communal Interactions</strong></p>
<p>Sales opportunities or profits should measure the ultimate success you get through social interactions. Interactions may also help you with sales opportunities; but, if you don’t close any of those leads, the campaign will be nothing but a disappointment, regardless of how many interactions were bred. Marketing is about drive higher sales in which evaluation is essential to know which strategy is functional.</p>
<p>Myth #5: <strong>Marketing Costs Nothing</strong></p>
<p>The marketing industry is booming on each successive day. The scope and the benefits your business will get are countless. With such broader scope, the industry plays a vital role in creating employment and also fruitful socio-economic progress. Though the use of social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube are all free to use, hidden costs always exist when applying a social media marketing campaign for most customer boost.</p>
<p>For an active and fetching social media promotion, you need an expert who prioritizes and implements the plan, be able to message, and monitors the mediums for customer response. And it is apparent that he will charge heavy bucks for this job.</p>

<h1>Facebook</h1>

With such colossal audience span, creating a page for business is necessary with daily updates with both engaging and exciting content. Try not to be so much promotional in this platform.</p>
<h1>Twitter</h1>
<p>The platform is full of interesting people, most of them are young. Today, the channel has more than 200 million active users. The 140 characters count of a tweet might be limited, but if it’s being used wisely, then it will payback you more than your thoughts. Twitter has its worth, importance to connect with people you want to interact with. And the good news is, once you get succeeded in gaining some popularity your account will take no time to go viral.</p>
<h1>YouTube</h1>
<p>YouTube is the most popular channel after Facebook. This video oriented site allows you create a Brand Account to give your business a YouTube presence of its own. With over 1 billion monthly visitors, it is the second largest search engine after Google. The YouTube market is competitive that invites engagement, sharing and theta users will enjoy.</p>
<p>Follow these three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to YouTube.com and sign in with your personal YouTube account credentials.</li>
<li>Create a YouTube Brand Account</li>
<li>Add Managers to your YouTube Brand Account</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the best channel relevant to your business. Keep the niche of your business in front of your mind and pick the most productive one!</p>
<p><strong><em>So, here are some tips:</em></strong></p>
<p>Tip #1: Check out each channel, study them and find out the channel which will work more effectively for your business. Try to consider some of the factors with each channel: The product or service you are offering and the available resources at your disposal. Social media is free, but your time is precious enough to care.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Don’t use every channel or sign up on every platform for just because they’re new in the market or getting popular on the souk. Instead, find out the channel which is most relevant, effective to the business you’ve chosen to appeal your customers.</p>
<p>Tip #3: Before you’re going to decide which channel is more effective to work on, try to work out on a clear and implementable strategy. Many entrepreneurs or marketers lose their business focus while trying to be social. A play helps you actually to stay focused on a particular social channel.</p>
<p>Tip #4:  Everything takes time and might be some investment to show its benefits. Social media is no exception. So, if it’s taking some time, don’t get frustrated. Stick with your channel and strategy. It takes time and an investment of your time over a persistent period to achieve results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Facebook is an important platform not only for social interactions but also for businesses</a>. It helps companies to reach their target audience and even to the competitors in the market. Unfortunately, Facebook’s News Feed algorithm is in a continuous state of uncertainty about what should be done.</p>
<p>The platform with more than 2 billion monthly active users, becoming critical or complicated for business owners to control their entrepreneurship and to have a presence on this platform.</p>
<p>If your business needs help staying up to date with the latest Facebook trends or making the most of its reach on the network, then I’ll let you know that it would be tough this time!</p>
<p>Facebook is changing the algorithm that functions the news feed, which presents a computer-curated selection of posts from other people and pages.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/14/6-easy-tips-increase-sales-website/">6 EASY TIPS TO INCREASE SALES ON YOUR WEBSITE</a></p>
<h1>How this new Facebook Algorithm Affect Me and My Business?</h1>
<ul>
<li>This new feed will display things from the people who are important to you than the things that are important for you.</li>
<li>From now, You will see less annoying stuff like fewer click bait and share=like posts, etc., as the new algorithm of Facebook restricts the number of posts, even though they may have many likes and shares, don’t encourage community engagement through conversation.</li>
<li>You will be going to see comparatively less Facebook videos that annoyed you. They will not blast you with fantastic max volume music and overzealous rattling sales pitches.</li>
<li>Your Facebook posts that people comment on will get more views.</li>
<li>You will see more posts from the people you know, or you love. Especially from those friends and family who you talk to the most. This is a step back, though not a full redaction, of a previous update, which began limiting the number of friends’ posts you see on your news feed.</li>
<li>You will see fewer posts and videos about topics you are interested in and more posts from friends you are interested in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your Facebook Business Strategies Will Have To Change:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The persona of your business will be damage, and your business’ voice will lessen down unless you change your Facebook Business Strategies. Here are some of the reasons:</li>
<li>An organic post which is not paid from brand pages and businesses will be shown a smaller amount than they have been in the previous.</li>
<li>Even the bulk amount of Likes and shares will not help your posts as they used to.</li>
<li>The chances are you may have to buy ads to get the same result, but your ads are more likely to perform better than they used to be.</li>
<li>You need some comments on your Facebook posts to achieve the same amount of popularity once you have earlier. This may not be much of a problem for pages with a massive following, but it can hurt small business pages.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Some Important Strategies:</strong></h2>
<h2>Increase your Social Perspectives or Horizons</h2>
<p>You would not waste your precious time with people who don’t like or ignore you. You can find your new friends. No exceptions with social media. Use some of the time you devote to Facebook to explore other options such as Linkedin, Twitter and YouTube are some names.</p>
<h2>Use More Live Video</h2>
<p>In future, Facebook will be presenting not more video to users, but that doesn’t reckon for live video. Live videos are engaging and Facebook like that. It will rank a live video in your business supporters’ feeds.</p>
<h2>Create Engaging Content</h2>
<p>Always remember that Content is king. So, make sure you are <a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/26-ways-to-create-engaging-content/">making a content that is valuable and engaging</a>. In fact, Facebook favor posts that get more eyeballs. You have to write compelling content relevant to the niche. Likes and shares are essential but not the primary factor in post popularity once the change is carried out. You need content that stimulates the commenting type of engagement.</p>

<h1>Get More Out Of SMM with Facebook Photo Contest</h1>
<p>If you want to engage your users with your post and generate a lead, then run a photo contest on Facebook. It is a smart way to get more eyeballs. You have to use any reliable app to run a contest in a tab on your page, and prompt your followers to submit photos related to your brand. This practice helps you to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">increase engagement and spread awareness of your Facebook page.</a></p>
<p>Beware about the rules of the Facebook contest. These should not be acceptable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like a page to enter</li>
<li>Share a page to join</li>
<li>Share a page on a friends Timeline to enter</li>
<li>Tag yourself in a photo to enter</li>
<li>Like multiple pages to enter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Run a Facebook Live Campaign</h2>
<p>In the past few years, live streaming is becoming more common. In fact, interacting with the fans can multiply a level of trustworthiness and authenticity to your social media marketing. This could be a live interview to answer the queries of your customers related to your brand; taking live calls or messages; to promote your latest line of products. By doing so, you can drive your audience’s attention in your brand.</p>
<h2>Run a Twitter Poll</h2>
<p>Twitter Poll is one of the less-used features. Running a poll on twitter is an excellent way to get engagement from your customers. They are engaging and a smart way to start a discussion with your followers. The Twitter poll offers you with endless options. They allow followers make decisions for you. So, see how these Polls help your business&#8217;s personality shine.</p>
<h2>Host a Livestream on your Instagram Story</h2>
<p>Instagram is a great platform to capture and share the world&#8217;s moments, Follow other, and discover accounts from all around the globe. This community with over 500 million users has made their live video broadcasting feature available for people. Instagram Livestreaming seems quite similar to Facebook live stream, but there’s some difference– the primary difference is that Instagram videos cannot be stored anywhere, meaning your viewers can only watch when you’re genuinely live. Use Instagram’s live video broadcasting and get creative with it and see how your followers respond! Post consistently</p>
<h2>Post Consistently on YouTube</h2>
<p>Give your viewers an enticement to subscribe to your YouTube channel with the guarantee of a constant strain of high-value content. Frequent posting is essential on YouTube just like other platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Your users will not be as fascinated in your channel if they don’t see you posting not regularly. For driving more traffic to channel, the best trick is to influence the traffic you breed on other platforms. Just feature your new video on your homepage and create a new blog post for it.</p>
<h2>End of the Line</h2>
<p>There you go – five simple tips for your professional social media marketing. I sure hope these tips will help you with your social strategy!</p>
