				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things like: death, taxes, and a question from people asking ‘So what do you do for a living’ are constant. But some things are not. Like, to give a suitable answer about how it should be a UX designer can be muddling even for many custom product designers.</p>
<p>I have seen so many people dealing with lots of problems in nailing down the answer of how to be a UX designer?</p>
<p>This is what I got from an expert:</p>
<p>“To be a UX designer, it is just like to be inside your users’ brain, to perceive design from the user’s perspective and to resolve expected confusions of users.”</p>
<p>It is like a never-ending route that requires keeping user experience prior more than anything. Though it is challenging to feel like a user, it is not impossible.</p>
<p>To guide your product design and make it bloom, I’ve collected several essential UX principles:</p>

<h1>Product Design Should Be Digestible:</h1>
<p>It would be easy to absorb or digest the product if it is simple and fulfils all the demands of users. You don’t need to spend lots of time or energy to see what things work. Consider all the things that help your product to make it the bottom of the funnel and opt the best one.</p>
<p>Design should be readable and easy to use to make users decide what to do. Users need proper guidelines, and you can do so by maintaining hierarchy and consistency in typography.</p>
<h1>Should Have Clarity:</h1>
<p>Beside things mentioned above, clarity is another thing that adds value to your product. One has to be very clear about his/her product.</p>
<p>With clarity in design, I mean to be very clear about product’s pricing. If users find any difficulty in figuring the price of a product, they’ll probably not buy that product. Therefore, it is important to mention price with ‘buy now’ ticker for better UX.</p>
<p>Making things as clear as possible should be your goal.</p>
<h1>Should Build Trust:</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">It is easy to trust if the design is good.</a> With honesty and clarity in explaining product’s features, one can build trust and increase conversions.</p>
<p>Consider Uber and its stress-free ride service. It is highly successful brand and a perfect example of building trust with consumers.</p>
<h1>Should Possess Familiarity:</h1>
<p>It is good if your product design is ground-breaking, but it should convert better. <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/10-ux-design-predictions-for-2018/">Offering entirely new framework and layout can be a UX killer.</a></p>
<p>Consider all the famous frameworks and layouts. Pay careful attention to each detail and use familiar patterns in your product to give it a native look.</p>
<h1>Should Be User-centric</h1>
<p>Being a product designer, you should have to build a thoughtful product with clear insight and intentions. The respective behavior towards product shows that you care about your users. It is also important as more than 60% of users give up your product just because they think you don’t care about them.</p>
<h1>WRAPPING IT UP</h1>
<p>It is quite easy to make the product as according to the UX canons. All you have to do is be very honest with yourself and perform each action from users’ perspective.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">Everyone wants their website to be successful</a>. Unfortunately, most of us don’t know much about how to make a site stand out in the competitive market.</p>
<p>It is not only a good web-design but also usability that makes your site successful. But, sometimes we neglect the customers’ ease of use and give more importance to other things.</p>
<p>A successful website is one that gets popularity and provides you with significant ROI. It is not always about the design but about the mix of everything that is suitable according to your niche. As you have created the website for customers and users, so it is essential to make it appropriate for them. A user-friendly approach to designing, developments, sorting and content generation can play a vital role in creating a website accessible and popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, people when visiting your site shouldn’t be confused about a single element; whether it is about content, page-loading, navigation, color or anything on site. If visitors get confused or find any difficulty using your site, they leave, and your site will get a poor reputation.</p>
<p>So, if you have been struggling for the user-friendly website, then read mentioned information carefully and try to implement these as well.</p>

<h1></h1>
<h1>1.    MOBILE- FRIENDLY</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today’s world where mobile web browsing becomes more common than desktop. It becomes a necessity to create a mobile-friendly website.</p>
<p>It is a task of a designer to test his/her website both on desktop and mobile. There’re many testing tools available in the market that are considered handy for both newbies and experts.</p>
<p>W3C mobileOK Checker, iPhone, iPad Peek, Gomez, MobiReady, dotMobi Emulator are some of the several tools which allow you to check speed, accessibility and overall performance of the site.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h2>2.    FAST-LOADING</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a web designer or developer, you must know how important your site loading time is. If it takes more than 5 sec to load, then it won’t be considered as a user-friendly site. Moreover delay in page loading may not only affect website’s usability but also it&#8217;s ranking.</p>
<p>Avoiding the additional videos, images, and plugins on the site can work more than wonder for your site. Furthermore, I would also suggest you check your website speed with KeyCDN Speed Test, Pingdom, Gtmetrix or any reliable tool you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3.    CLEARLY-DEFINED AND ORGANIZED STRUCTURE</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the website looks unorganized or cluttered, then users may find hectic to get their required information from the site.</p>
<p>All you can do to make a site organized and synchronized for users are; make your website layout or design simple enough; always put organized or relevant content; add relevant or useful call-to-action to the site, follow a single theme for every page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.    CONSISTENCY</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The website you’re creating should be user-centric. In other words, it should be designed while keeping user’s behavior, choices, preferences, and their comfort in mind.</p>
<p>Users feel comfortable when they find each and everything consistent or relevant on site. It is your job to maintain consistency and familiarity with elements, design, typography, color, navigation on the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5.    VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a visual web design is another way to make your site user-friendly. Visual design is all about how you aesthetically bring color, images, typography and other elements together to improve the user`s experience.</p>
<p>Pulling all the website elements altogether also requires the wise use of white space, line, shapes and showing the hierarchy between different items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6.    STRONG MARKET RESEARCH</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strong market research is essential for creating a user-friendly website, with the help of which you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/55-ways-to-increase-engagement-with-your-target-audience/">Target customers that are relevant to your brand.</a></li>
<li>Consider approaches that can give you good Return on Investment.</li>
<li>Conduct prototype testing which will allow you to avoid future errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, there are many other elements you can go through to make your site more user-friendly. But the elements mentioned above are vital which you cannot ignore.</p>
