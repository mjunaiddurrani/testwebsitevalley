				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever laid your eyes on a logo that’s just plain bad? I bet you have. It seems like a terrible thing to say, but it’s a fact that the increase in bad logo designs are increasing. Laymen or design professionals, no matter who you are, some logos are just too hard to like. Some people actually consider a bad logo to be a reflection of ‘brand weakness’. Believe it or not, these ‘people’ happen to be some of the best design professionals in the world.</p>
<p>So, if you’re a logo designer or maybe a logo design company that designed a bad logo, does that make you a bad design professional/agency? The answer is no. Even the best of us make mistakes. However, these mistakes come back to haunt you heavily when the time comes. Why wait for a career suicide when you can work on the red flags and turn them green?</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’ll be discussing some of the most prominent mistakes that logo designers make frequently. So without running around in circles, let’s jump right into it.</p>
<h2><strong>A Very Busy Logo Design</strong></h2>
<p>This is perhaps one of the biggest mistakes that I’ve seen over the years. In fact, I’ve seen esteemed experts in the design industry such as Jason Li, Co-Founder of Tum Yum DeSignagency discuss this problem in the past as well. You can have a look at his blog <a href="https://medium.com/tomyum/logo-design-af5080273895">here</a>.</p>

<p>A busy logo is always going to get a bad impression from the targeted audience. If there’s too much going on in the logo design, your potential custom won’t know where to pay attention. One of the many reasons why minimal design is progressing in general. There’s always one ‘sweet spot’ in your logo that really is key in creating results. When there’s too much happening in the logo, you won’t really get the chance to impress your customer. Of course, elements are important to your logo, but make sure the design in the perfect flow. Focus on not overcrowding the logo with unnecessary elements. In most cases, one single element is enough to do the trick.</p>

<h2><strong>Poor Focus on Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>This mistake is one of the most repetitive mistakes that I’ve seen happen. This even happens to the biggest of brands. As a logo designer and/or as a logo deSignagency, you need to realize that the logo isn’t solely visible on one placement. From social media display pictures to business cards, the brand identity needs to customize itself. A huge part of the brand identity is the logo design itself and that’s where things get rough.</p>

<p>Thorough research on the logo design placements is very important. As a design professional, you need to have a list of placements lined up to offer the client. You can also include this as a question in your design brief. Most of the times, clients aren’t well aware of brand identity. As a logo design professional, it is your duty to not only educate the client but assist them as well.</p>
<h2><strong>A Victim to Cliché </strong></h2>
<p>Now, this is one mistake that sometimes rattles up a lot of logo designers and even logo design companies. From the sparks, to the bevels and even the swooshes, there are several cliché design trends that are overused in the industry.</p>

<p>What confuses graphic designers around the world is that at one hand people endorse design trends and at the other, hate them in general. Well, it’s simple. There are several areas where design trends actually work. Logo Design isn’t one of them. A notable example is Material Design that is being followed by designers worldwide for app and web design. On the contrary, it can’t be used in the field of logo design. Logos define individuality and if there’s even a small similarity between two logos, the logo isn’t worth it. To avoid this mistake, research is key. Make the most out of your research and your logo design will almost always be a masterpiece with its standalone brilliance.</p>
<p>All in all, these are three of the biggest mistakes that are consistently invading the logo design industry. Your logo is vital for your business, regardless of your industry. Focus on your brand’s identity and it will change the way your customers react to your business in general. A rookie mistake can ruin your business completely and that’s not a chance that you should take. For excellent logo design services, consider The Web Founders.
