Some have incorporated minimal principle, and some are the exemplification of maximalism principle.

<h1><strong>1.  </strong><strong>Go With Plan </strong></h1>
<p>Always go with planning. Pre-planned things are more likely to succeed than unplanned things. Make sure you are planning each thing properly. How your logo should be, what customers will be its targeting, what message it will convey, how flexible it should be, and there are countless things need to be planned.</p>
<h2><strong>2.  </strong><strong>Don’t Fall For Premade Custom Logos, Hire an Expert</strong></h2>
<p>That’s completely fine if you know not much about logo designing since you are an entrepreneur, not a designer. There’s always a good alternative. Hire an expert designer who knows basic to advance principles of designs, color psychology, and possesses years of experience in the reputable organization.</p>
<p>Commonly, many people have been seen going for a premade logos. Premade or ready-made logos are not appropriate for your business. They are not unique and so should not be used.</p>
<h2><strong>3.  </strong><strong>Don’t Complicate, Make It Simple</strong></h2>
<p>Things if not simple, will sucks – to you and to your customers who are speculating on your logo and have lots of expectations from you. It is not good in any way to make them angry and confused. In fact, the purpose of the logo is to convey brand’s message. If they are multifaceted, they will not serve their primary goal.</p>
<h2><strong>4.  </strong><strong>Avoid Unnecessariness, Incorporate Only Needed Things</strong></h2>
<p>This point is an extension of them &#8211;. With simplicity, it meant to incorporate only things your logo needs or you think essential to add. Take a paper and pen out. Write about your business—what your business is about, who your customers are, what they do, and all. Write five two-three lines on each and then summarize. Hand over this summary to your designer and ask him to incorporate them as much as possible. Heavy ornaments, loud color tones, excessive text are the things can make your design meager.</p>
<h2><strong>5.  </strong><strong>Get Some Inspiration</strong></h2>
<p>The present market is overflowing with a number of good-to-inspire logo designs. Why not take some inspiration and take a hold of the good things from them? Research the market, get some good logo designs to see, study them and take inspiration for your coming business logo. By inspiration, it doesn’t mean to steal their work.</p>
<h2><strong><u>Last Thought</u></strong></h2>
<p>The logo is crucial for your business. Make it stand out and noticeable. Make your business well-known in the eyes of the public and get more sales. Directly or indirectly, it all starts with your logo, so don’t compromise with its eminence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether your business is about medicine, food, sport or anything else. It does not matter what the nature of your business is – it is crucial to design logos in timeless and memorable manner. <a href="https://www.bluesodapromo.com/blog/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-logo-design/">For designing a logo, it is important to understand certain things</a>. Every single line, shape, color, and form are important in making a conscious decision when it comes to design a logo for your business.</p>
<p>So, in this blog, I’ll talk about the important concept – a Figure-Ground relationship that will help you create a timeless business logo. Let’s look what it’s all about!</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/13/design-matters-rebrand-brand/">WHY DESIGN MATTERS FOR REBRAND YOUR BRAND</a></p>
<h1>SO, WHAT IS FIGURE-GROUND RELATIONSHIP IN CUSTOM LOGO FOR YOUR BUSINESS?</h1>
<p>Figure and ground are two terms with different meanings. The figure refers to the positive space in the logo design. Whereas, ground refers to the background or negative space in the emblem. Commonly, a logo is visually prevailing in the figure. Sometimes, the elements of the figure are ground dominating instead of being figure dominant.</p>
<h2>WHY THE CONCEPT IS IMPORTANT FOR CUSTOM LOGO DESIGNERS?</h2>
<p>When it comes to the importance of Figure-Ground relationship in logos, look Gestalt Principle. It will tell you that design is perceived as a unified whole. Figure-Ground Relationship is an extension of the Gestalt Principle.</p>
<p>When people view a logo, they see individual elements and categorize it in relationships. It means negative space is equally important as positive space because both spaces exist in relation and depend on each other.</p>
<h2>KINDS OF FIGURE GROUND RELATIONSHIPS:</h2>
<p>There are three types of figure-ground relationships. These are:</p>
<h2>1.    Constant Figure-Ground Relationship:</h2>
<p>This type allows a person to differentiate a ground and figure in the logo design easily. For making logo stable enough, the designer has to make one thing dominant over other. For instance, they can make negative space more prominent over positive space in the design.</p>
<h2>2.    Reversible Figure-Ground Relationship</h2>
<p>Both figure and the ground get equal attention in this type. In such design, there is space for the ground to take over the figure and for the figure to take over the ground. By doing so, it creates a sort of ambiguity.</p>
<h2>3.    Ambiguous Figure-Ground Relationship</h2>
<p>This type of relationship makes it quite difficult for spectators to separate ground from the figure in design. In such designs, viewers cannot detect a focal point. Although, it is ideal for creating patterns in the logo.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE THE CONCEPT IN DESIGNING</h2>
<p>So, if you want to create distinct figure ground relationships in the logo, here is what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create stark figure-ground distinction by using contrasting colors. Using warm colors against a cool and cool against a warm background you can create a compelling contrast. This is especially helpful for users to recognize and read the text.</li>
<li>Make the ground non-existent in your logo, so that figure in design dominates the ground. You need to amplify and prominent the figure elements so that the ground becomes insignificant.</li>
<li>A blurred background acts well against a text. It is another way to make the figure-ground relationship blatant. In fact, it is a key technique in filmmaking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>END OF THE LINE</h2>
<p>So, these are the things you should consider about <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">making your business logo according to the figure-ground relationship concept</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The logo is a face of the brand that explains what your brand is. Designing a right logo can lead your business towards success. Logo designing is not an easy task; it requires strong research about the ongoing and even upcoming tends.</p>
<p>Following are the five essential tips to know for crafting a killer logo:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/02/27/8-effective-seo-tips-rank-beginner-website/">8 effective SEO tips to rank beginner website</a></p>
<h1>Identify your brand</h1>
<p>The logo is an explanation of your business that should be potent enough to communicate with the targeted audience. Therefore, it should possess all the elements of the business that are mandatory to be delivered to the audience. List the things about your brand and especially its ideology. Link your ideologies with symbols and elements that best convey your brand`s message and use these elements smartly to create a logo. Be precise, use hidden clues and follow ‘less is more strategy’.</p>
<h2>Color’s psyche</h2>
<p>Remember your brand’s logo is not just a small colorful image. In fact, it involves a whole psyche of colors behind each element. Color psyche is vital to know in <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">logo designing</a>.  Some shades of colors are considered as harsh while some are cool. According to the color theory, the red color is considered as energetic while the orange shade produces friendly or youthful vibes. Yellow is used for cheerfulness, and the green color is for instructional purposes. The blue tones are used in professional or medical product logo.  Purple is for spirituality, black demonstrates power, white reflects simplicity, whereas pink color is commonly used in toys or other babies’ stuff. So try to opt the most appropriate color as per your business nature and customers psyche.</p>
<h2>Timelessness</h2>
<p>Timelessness matters a lot. Because you’re crafting a logo that will stay for years. So, try to come up with a design that is productive enough to interact with the people of not only today but tomorrow. Study deeply about the social transformations; how choices are changing, what are the values of people and other social trends. While studying the present design trends, try to predict the upcoming trends and make your logo accordingly.</p>
<h2>Thorough Research</h2>
<p>Research is mandatory in every aspect of designing to get success, including <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/02/the-ultimate-guide-to-logo-design/">logo designing.</a> Even the brands with the big name have their separate research team that is responsible for brief market trends, social aspects, market drifts, risk factors, etc. They study audience, their preferences, brand’s competitors, company’s long-term goals and every single aspect of the business that helps logo to stand out from the others.</p>
<p>Most of the start-up companies do not possess separate research panels for designing a logo.Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn`t. But it would be nearly impossible for the logo to fail to grab attention if all the aspects were thoroughly-researched.</p>
<h2>Simplicity and minimalism</h2>
<p>Try to keep logo as simple as possible because your logo will be used everywhere – from site to pamphlets or even from shoes to clothes. The heavy ornamentations, large fonts, clashing colors schemes can ruin your logo.</p>
<p>Consider popular logo designs too, and see how the simplicity works. One of the best examples of simplicity is NIKE, we all know how famous the logo is and how simple it is. It is a perfect example of minimalism approach while creating a logo. On the other hand, complicated logo designs are less likely preferable because complex logos are tough to identify. They are less memorable and less appealing.</p>
<p>Lastly, remember your logo is your brand’s identification. Follow mentioned tips to make a killer logo.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever laid your eyes on a logo that’s just plain bad? I bet you have. It seems like a terrible thing to say, but it’s a fact that the increase in bad logo designs are increasing. Laymen or design professionals, no matter who you are, some logos are just too hard to like. Some people actually consider a bad logo to be a reflection of ‘brand weakness’. Believe it or not, these ‘people’ happen to be some of the best design professionals in the world.</p>
<p>So, if you’re a logo designer or maybe a logo design company that designed a bad logo, does that make you a bad design professional/agency? The answer is no. Even the best of us make mistakes. However, these mistakes come back to haunt you heavily when the time comes. Why wait for a career suicide when you can work on the red flags and turn them green?</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’ll be discussing some of the most prominent mistakes that logo designers make frequently. So without running around in circles, let’s jump right into it.</p>
<h2><strong>A Very Busy Logo Design</strong></h2>
<p>This is perhaps one of the biggest mistakes that I’ve seen over the years. In fact, I’ve seen esteemed experts in the design industry such as Jason Li, Co-Founder of Tum Yum DeSignagency discuss this problem in the past as well. You can have a look at his blog <a href="https://medium.com/tomyum/logo-design-af5080273895">here</a>.</p>

<p>A busy logo is always going to get a bad impression from the targeted audience. If there’s too much going on in the logo design, your potential custom won’t know where to pay attention. One of the many reasons why minimal design is progressing in general. There’s always one ‘sweet spot’ in your logo that really is key in creating results. When there’s too much happening in the logo, you won’t really get the chance to impress your customer. Of course, elements are important to your logo, but make sure the design in the perfect flow. Focus on not overcrowding the logo with unnecessary elements. In most cases, one single element is enough to do the trick.</p>
<p><strong>Also </strong>Read: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/07/21/design-brief-things-you-need-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Design Brief – Things You Need To Focus On</strong></a></p>
<h2><strong>Poor Focus on Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>This mistake is one of the most repetitive mistakes that I’ve seen happen. This even happens to the biggest of brands. As a logo designer and/or as a logo deSignagency, you need to realize that the logo isn’t solely visible on one placement. From social media display pictures to business cards, the brand identity needs to customize itself. A huge part of the brand identity is the logo design itself and that’s where things get rough.</p>

<p>Thorough research on the logo design placements is very important. As a design professional, you need to have a list of placements lined up to offer the client. You can also include this as a question in your design brief. Most of the times, clients aren’t well aware of brand identity. As a logo design professional, it is your duty to not only educate the client but assist them as well.</p>
<h2><strong>A Victim to Cliché </strong></h2>
<p>Now, this is one mistake that sometimes rattles up a lot of logo designers and even logo design companies. From the sparks, to the bevels and even the swooshes, there are several cliché design trends that are overused in the industry.</p>

<p>What confuses graphic designers around the world is that at one hand people endorse design trends and at the other, hate them in general. Well, it’s simple. There are several areas where design trends actually work. Logo Design isn’t one of them. A notable example is Material Design that is being followed by designers worldwide for app and web design. On the contrary, it can’t be used in the field of logo design. Logos define individuality and if there’s even a small similarity between two logos, the logo isn’t worth it. To avoid this mistake, research is key. Make the most out of your research and your logo design will almost always be a masterpiece with its standalone brilliance.</p>
<p>All in all, these are three of the biggest mistakes that are consistently invading the logo design industry. Your logo is vital for your business, regardless of your industry. Focus on your brand’s identity and it will change the way your customers react to your business in general. A rookie mistake can ruin your business completely and that’s not a chance that you should take. For excellent logo design services, consider The Web Founders.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Typography is undoubtedly one of the most prestigious yet complex disciplines in graphic design. It doesn’t matter how skilled you are in this specific domain of graphic design, there’s something always to learn. The weird part about typography is that it isn’t constant from any angle. There are several different fonts, hundreds of different combination and thousands of different concepts that fall under the umbrella of typography.</p>
<p>Our team of creative thinkers love to share their ideas here at the The Web Founders blog to help young design talent in becoming better every passing day. Here are a few tips and tricks to keep your creative juices flowing.</p>
<h2><strong>Invest Time</strong></h2>
<p>Keep one thing in mind: good typography, takes time. Invest as much time as you can to create something incomparable. Search for a typeface that suits your idea, background, color, shapes in the picture and much more. Starting with basic fonts can be easier but continuing to work only with the basics isn’t the right route to the future. Keep your research strong and invest your time properly on your typography for excellent results.</p>

<h2><strong>Limit Your Typefaces</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, you need a combination of different fonts but you need to limit your typefaces to a maximum of 2 or 3. Anything more than 5 fonts per design is just going to take the essence away from the design. Use fewer designs with a bigger impact on the design to create results that actually matter for your business.</p>
<h2><strong>Trends Can Be Deceiving</strong></h2>
<p>Futureproofing a superior design is important but falling victim to trends just might be a huge mistake. Trends can be deceiving! It doesn’t matter if the latest designs in the industry use Gotham or Trebuchet, if they don’t go with your brand and your design you don’t have to use it. Pay attention to the design and make sure it’s as perfect as can be.</p>
