				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is a general observation that the main focus of most B2B businesses is more inclined towards generating and converting leads, and therefore, they tend to ignore the potential of a B2B-optimzied web design for their business. A majority of them are of the view that a plain website that has all of their products and services listed is enough to maintain their presence in the cyber world.</p>
<p><em>However, they couldn’t be more wrong. </em></p>
<p>Web design plays a significant role for B2B and B2C businesses alike. While the B2C business industry has long realized the significance of action-oriented site design and reaping maximum benefits out of it, B2B businesses are clearly leaving a lot of potential on the table.</p>
<p>Here’s why a B2B centric web design is important for your business.</p>

<h1>§  Branding</h1>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/design-the-right-marketing-organization-for-the-next-decade/">website is the personification</a> of your business in the cyber sphere, and people – including your customers, leads as well as your competitors – will turn to it whenever they are looking for you online. It is your digital shop front and reflects the quality, credibility and professionalism of your business. A B2B centric web design will optimize your website for on-point branding in the online market.</p>
<h2>§  Conversion</h2>
<p>The purpose of a website is to provide information about your business and attract more visitors. But more than that, it should also be able to convert your leads. Therefore, for successful conversions, your website design should be such that it compels visitors to make a purchase decision. This can easily be done by incorporating creative and informative content, simplistic navigation, and strong CTAs. If your site design is not sales-oriented, it wouldn’t facilitate online sales – no matter you are a B2B or B2C enterprise.</p>
<h2>§  Search Engine Ranking</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.newbreedmarketing.com/blog/b2b-web-design-examples">B2B optimized website design</a> will enhance your online visibility and exposure among your online audience by improving your search engine ranking. B2B centric web designs feature custom images, unique content, convenient navigation and a user-friendly interface – and that’s what Google encourages and rewards with better rankings. In addition to that, a blog to complement your website, that’s regularly updated will do wonders in improving your search engine ranking and will help you garner maximum social media response.</p>
<h2>§  Accessibility</h2>
<p>Mobile responsiveness and cross-platform compatibility has become essential for a website to perform at its best and attract maximum traffic. Your customers, leads, competitors and everyone else looking for your business online refer to your site from different sources. While a majority of online searches today are being made through mobiles and handheld devices, your website should still be optimized to be compatible with different desktop and mobile devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how you can optimize your website to make it more B2B oriented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know your target audience</li>
<li><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Use high-quality custom graphics</a></li>
<li>Add a human touch</li>
<li>Facilitate engagement</li>
</ul>
