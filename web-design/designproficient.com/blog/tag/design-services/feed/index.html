				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s not that difficult to get busy in the day to day workings of your business. You may think that you have less or no time to make your online presence prominent. Many of us feel about content or products as the lifeblood of great brand experiences. But most of us take for granted the <a href="https://www.bluefrogdm.com/blog/brand-strategy-the-top-5-benefits-of-rebranding">importance of having a great design in rebranding.</a></p>
<p>But, why brands need to take a step of rebranding their existing brands?</p>
<p>Being a businessperson, you can have many reasons as to why you want to rebrand your existing business. It will benefit you to list down all your aims and objectives before starting anything or else the idea to rebrand will only run down your business’ image.</p>
<p>When you already know about your objectives you can prepare yourself better and make yourself more attentive towards the act. Some of the good reasons for rebranding could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the existing persona of your company</li>
<li><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Give importance to the new set of brand promotions</a></li>
<li>Deal or recover with the negative image of the business</li>
</ul>

<h1>Here’s why great design matters to your brand:</h1>
<p>No doubt people coming from different backgrounds love things that are well-structured or have an appealing design. Like, a trendy new restaurant will make more customers if it has an enthralling design compared to that one with unappealing designed. In fact, there are many studies which show that great brand design not only makes people cheerier, it also makes them pay more money for your brand.</p>
<p>Like, there are numerous local neighborhood restaurants which have been running successfully for decades and do the fine job without any flashy branding sparkles. They still perform their tasks what people need – offer delicious food and best services.</p>
<h2>Other Reasons: Why Great Design Matters For Rebrand your Brand?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Even dots and dashes matter in your design. If you give importance to details, then you will be perceived as a premium by your customers.</li>
<li>The first impression is the last impression. It is true, and you can create strong experiences. Especially, if you’re a new brand owner.</li>
<li>You can make your customers feel better and as I said above to make them spend more time on your product.</li>
<li>The excellent design ensures your content remains user-friendly and so search friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Lastly, I would say rebranding your existing brand can be equally difficult as branding the first time. Whether you are doing this for the first time or the third time you need to be very careful about every step.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a freelance graphic designer, it’s a very common thought to create your own small business by offering design services to multiple clients. However, some designers offer design services as freelancers while others have a full business setup revolving around all design aspects required for their clients. Regardless of the nature of your design services, it is only fair to say that if any kind of design service needs to see growth the company or individual needs to know who they are targeting. Many designers believe that their services cater to everyone but that’s not true, in order to make it available for everyone they will have to use a lot of their <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">resources </a>which at the end of the day becomes an unnecessary risk when considering that they can easily just focus on targeting their clientele and in return saving time for producing quality work for their customers. Here are some basic steps that might help in the process of identifying your target market before you start designing.</p>
<h2>Who are they?</h2>
<p>The first thing is to know your target audience thoroughly. What they do, what they like, what they dislike, the type of products they use, what’s their age bracket. If you manage to answer some of these basic questions then be rest assured that you are on your way to chalking out a definite target market. The next step will be to get in-depth research material on your target audience. Further identifying your audience’s needs and requirements.</p>
<h2>Thorough Research.</h2>
<p>It’s not rocket science to find more information about your targeted audience. All the resources are out there to help you to literally know behavior patterns of your audience. Their purchasing habits, their favorite music genres, restaurants, favorite foods, fashion trends etc. All you have to do is use and study the demographics that are provided by most of the top social media platforms. This step is compulsory if you want to obtain and maintain a long lasting relationship with your customers.</p>
<h2>Identifying your next step.</h2>
<p>Once you have thoroughly identified and studied your targeted audiences, you now have to lock down how you’re going to satisfy your customer’s needs, what are the design elements you’re going to have to use that will help in leaving you with happy customers. Get into the details, chalk out the type of fonts your audience will appreciate, the color schemes that they find most attractive. This also allows you to throw in the element of surprise which always helps in getting more attention. Get comfortable with the knowledge that you have gained and start thinking of creative ways to execute the knowledge that you have acquired.</p>
<h2>Start Designing!</h2>
<p>At this point you should have all the information and research required to allow you to start putting your creative design ideas on paper, tailor made for your audience. You should know exactly what kind of design basics are required, like the typeface, color scheme, typography etc. Now is the time for you to bring out the designer in you and go crazy with it. Use the information about your audience in the most creative way possible and let your designing skills take over.</p>
<p>There you have it. Use the above basic guidelines and rest assured to have a design that will definitely please and cater to your audiences’ needs to the fullest. Good Luck!</p>
