				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If this is the first time that you are hiring a digital marketing agency or changing your current affiliate agency, you need to make serious preparations. You got to start with a history search, build a list of agencies, and determine who will make sales calls.</p>
<p>However, the sales call itself can be a little tricky. An agent’s sales representative may simply sell the product through the service and end up asking for more than necessary. As a company that tries to invest a lot of money in outsourcing, you need to make sure you are talking to the right people. When asking the right questions, you should be able to discuss and understand the important facts that your diligence has not collected.</p>
<p>There is a saying in the marketing world that is correct, but unfortunately, it is widespread. In most cases, however vague, “it depends” is the accurate response to most marketing questions. This saying applies to marketers and customers. Each client has individual needs, and each agency has its own skills. So what if your company is looking for a</p>
<p>that can effectively communicate your goals and values? Before continuing the interview with a potential agency, the following questions will help you determine if the agency is right for you.</p>
<h2>1.What Are The Main Industries You Work With?</h2>
<p>The way they answer that question will determine how far they understand the distinctions of your industry. The more they know the companies in their industry, the faster they can produce results. However, if they do not mention their sector or similar industry, it means that they may not have direct knowledge of the strategies to be applied. This is not an agreement that can solve the problem in all situations, but it is definitely worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Specific marketing procedures can indeed produce excellent results in almost all situations, but different sectors require changed methods. Make sure that the brand organization is able to explain the strategic differences between medical device companies and academia.</p>
<h2>2. What Is Your Agency’s Culture?</h2>
<p>Determining the agency culture you want to work with is imperative for developing honest and long-term relationships with their team. The better the relationship with the agency, the better it will do for you. Visit the agency from time to time (especially the account manager). On average, you find yourself as a group customer 4 to 6 times a year. Make sure they match your business and values. If the agency you are looking for is a person, you need to like that person.</p>
<h2>3. What Do Your Reports Look like?</h2>
<p>Mathematics is a universal language, but not everyone is particularly proficient. If you need reports provided by agencies in a translated form, they are not very good. Good reports are practical and transparent, and the reports themselves need to be translated. A right agency will also explain how to use, maintain, and understand the work you provide, but their work reports must be self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Another critical factor in the agency’s report is time. The frequency with which they report to other customers is a good indication of the frequency with which they report to you. The “good” timings depend on your needs. For example, do you need to receive a report before a particular day to receive the bonus, or do you just try to send and receive reports once a year to reduce confusion?</p>
<h2>4. Can You Manage Our Social Media Platforms?</h2>
<p>Your business should try to find an agency that uses existing marketing strategies to serve your target audience. Many consumers expect social media analytics, insights, and a company’s overall appeal before making a purchase decision. To be kept informed, you need to use social media platforms actively. Ask the potential agency about the latest plans for your social media and connect your company’s brand to your followers. Find out if they have a content strategy and how to use it across all social media platforms.</p>
<h2>5. Does Your Company Offer Web Design Services?</h2>
<p>A company needs to have a website that performs efficiently on both PCs and mobile devices. Ask your agency how to make your site respond to multiple devices and how long it takes to get results. It can also be useful to ask your agency about other sites that they have created for you and see what the agency is doing.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that the agency uses the website template or custom design created by each website. Ask how much your company is investing in the design and layout of your website and any concerns you may have, such as pop-up surveys or adding security features to your website.</p>
<h2>6. What Is Your Most Successful Project Till Date</h2>
<p>Customer testimonials and case studies are social evidence that <strong><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">experienced digital marketing agencies</a></strong> should get on their websites. However, if you see them, you don’t have to stop there. It would be best if you asked some follow-up queries to close the loopholes. If you can’t find social evidence on their website or what they have don’t relevant to your work, ask the agency to show how they can help you. If the agency is newly established, it must have the best portfolio on its website for referrals from future clients.</p>
<h2>7. How Much Would This Project Cost And What Is The Fee Structure?</h2>
<p>Before the agency starts anything, the cost of the project must be determined. Ask your agency about the fees and total cost of creating a project in an hour, as well as other costs, such as maintaining a website and stock photos. Let’s take it one step closer, what happens when a project exceeds your budget, and when you have to pay an agent. When asking these questions, remember to take your budget with you.</p>
<p>How do agency charges? Will you charge an hour for a fixed price, or will I be charged whenever a new user is assigned to a task? You should ask about any hidden fees that may be incurred by the agency. In addition to the average price range, it is important to take seriously how they view your success and how it compares to your salary.</p>
<h2>8. When Have You Failed?</h2>
<p>This is an important question but often overlooked when hiring any agency. While asking about examples of their work, you want to see at least one example of a failed project or ask them when they failed. By not learning, exposing the mistakes of the past and the ways they learned from them revealed the true “agility” and “adaptability” of the agency.</p>
<h2>9. How Does Your Company Utilize Content?</h2>
<p>It would be best if you had an agency that can create content that conveys the image of your business through numerous channels. The blog contains keywords that your company’s target users are looking for to help increase traffic to your site. Print and digital advertising, TV advertising, email marketing, and online video are also effective strategies for leveraging content creation. Ask the agency how they plan to share the content and how often they make new content.</p>
<h2>10. What Is The Project Timeline?</h2>
<p>Ask your agency the actual time of the proposed project. Ask them how they contact your company and how you can connect with your potential agency. In addition, the agency should be able to explain to you the project process you have submitted and how they intend to measure the results of the project.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Choosing an agency as a digital marketing partner for your brand is not a quick and easy process. There are many options, many different styles, and many potential consequences (good and bad) in the business that you may face as a result of your decision. When asking potential agency, the questions described in this article will help you better understand the digital marketing agency you are looking for and your own goals and preferences. After all, the choice is yours, so consider your choice carefully.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google ranking is the fluctuating position of your website in the search engine result page which determines the success and failure of your website. It is not always possible to retain a stable ranking position for a longer time as it always fluctuates upward and downward.</p>
<p>It is necessary for you to have a nicely built search engine friendly website by complying with proper search marketing strategies to help your website retain the 1st-page ranking.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will discuss the 8 things which do not directly affect your Google ranking.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/08/02/boost-business-revenue/">Boost Your Business Revenue With These 3 Steps</a></p>
<h1>Website age</h1>
<p>Website age is an essential search engine optimization factor which does not directly affect your ranking.  The older age registration of your website domain does provide a reliable source of authority and trust for Google. However, the necessary things to do are quality relevant backlink profile which increases the value of the website with original quality content which drives the attention of readers.</p>
<h1>Social sharing</h1>
<p>Social sharing links also do not affect your Google ranking. As Google keeps no concerns with your increasing number of shares, likes, and tweet counts. However, social sharing does help in boosting valuable traffic for your website. Social sharing helps in building a strong brand portfolio for your website to reach more audience with an increase in reputation.</p>
<h1>Bounce rate</h1>
<p>Bounce rate is the stepping back of the visitor from your website. It spoils the <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">reputation of your website in Google</a>. The higher bounce rate leads to a lower click-through rate with a decrease in website traffic. The good or bad bounce rate does not affect your website ranking. It is suitable for your website to sustain visitors by producing quality engaging content with more dwell time.</p>
<h1>Heading tags</h1>
<p>The heading tags are HTML tags which comprise of six varieties of tags ranging from h1 to h6. The &lt;h1&gt; is the most substantial heading tag and &lt;h6&gt; is the smallest heading tags in your website. These tags do not affect your website ranking but are necessary for showing the website status.</p>
<h1>Robots.txt and XML sitemap</h1>
<p>The robots.txt is Meta source file which has a purpose of restricting the bots to crawl the specific pages in your website. XML sitemap provides the fast crawling and indexing of your website pages to let know Google about them. These files do not affect your ranking of the website but are essential factors for SEO.</p>
<h1>Meta keywords</h1>
<p>Meta keywords are the generic list of HTML keywords which help to show up ranking for your website. The use of these Meta keywords is not much recommended in modern <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">SEO</a>, and they also do not much affect your website ranking.</p>
<h1>Alt Image Keywords</h1>
<p>The purpose of the alt image tag is to provide ranking by labeling a keyword title to your website images. The alt image keywords also do not affect much to your website ranking.</p>
<h1>Schema markup</h1>
<p>Schema markup is an ideal technique to boost up enhanced and dynamic search listing for your website. It better works for local businesses, book reviews, movies, and restaurants. The use of schema markup also does not affect your website ranking.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard the saying, Content is fire; web design is its fuel? If so, you must know the importance of content is as same as the design of a site is. A content that is not unique, fresh, genuine, as per your customers’ preferences cannot give any benefit to you. Holding the gigantic significance, unique content is something you cannot overlook its importance in catching numerous eyeballs from people coming from different rivalries. Unique content is original and not duplicated anywhere else.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h1>Unique Content Can Educate People about Your Professional Website</h1>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Content is a resource of information which can be used to educate search engines about what your business caters to and how unique you are. It is important to bear in mind your website is depicted to search engines and must have to communicate your website’s purpose accurately. Try to optimize your website and permit search engine to know when to show your site in the results for appropriate search queries.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Unique Content Can Help You Raise in Search Engine</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keywords are considered to be essential for ranking. Keywords refer that you are looking for online prominence and that best define your products and services. Content should always reflect your keyword strategy. Content is a great place to highlight the relevant keywords in a natural, harmonious way and to support search engines make the connection between the keywords and your website that you have incorporated in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Unique Content Can Help You with Social Validation</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The importance of customers in business progress is undeniable. Earning their trust is essential to get that mark you always dream of. In chasing this dream, you have to give them the thing they want more from you: Social validation. I have seen numerous web pages and blog posts ranking well due to the social validation. This can be attained by trial and error method and lots of consideration. For business ranging from small to medium-sized business, the only way you can get social validation is by the quality and unique content writing.</p>
<p><strong>So, How To Write A Unique And Appealing Content?</strong></p>
<p>Here are few guidelines to incorporate in your writing style:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never steal a word from other resource. Stay away from plagiarism by citing research and using your own words to explain the topic.</li>
<li>Do not stick on one resource. Better to use multiple sources when researching.</li>
<li>Give your text a unique structure.</li>
<li>Incorporate your individual style.</li>
<li>Keep reliance on your rational thinking. Explain things how you comprehend them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>LAST THOUGHT</u></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">When your content is high in quality</a>, it delivers value. When your content provides people with what they are on the lookout for, they lean towards to engage with your content through numerous means. And this is how your content will earn it&#8217;s acknowledged and helps your website raise in search engine results.</p>

<h1><strong>Catches the attention of People </strong></h1>

Take your precious time out and make your design appealing for your people.</p>
<ul>

<p>We often overlooked the importance of design. It plays a vital role when it comes to convincing customers to buy your product. Design matters a lot, the inner material is packed and somehow hidden, but the <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">design is the most revealing thing can help you a lot to convince customers buying your products.</a> Leave nothing to persuade them.</p>

Your top quality work and consistency are what people require, and these are the things help you beat your competitors in the market.</p>

</ol>
<p>Fresh, new, genuine content is like a fuel for your business. It can work to resolve many of the issues that your business is facing and presents you with a chance to position your business in the center of your target audience. If the content is compelling, interesting and on the recent topics, it can earn more attention. The user-centric is the only things which you cannot take as an optional. Write a genuine and fresh blog or web content relevant to your business. Make your content highly-relevant to your potential readers’ preferences. Understand their opinions and think about their likes and dislikes before writing any content. The headlines and titles get more attention and require more consideration.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Properly Optimized Web Content</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After preparing the content, get all your attention towards optimization. Proper optimization is a need. Incorporate relevant keywords into the content. Here, you cannot go recklessly. You have to be very wise and responsible about what keywords should be added on a content. For this, research thoroughly your audience about what word(s) they will use to search you on the search engine. Incorporate them into your content. However, do not use more than three or four keywords in one webpage. Exceed can be harmful, and even Google can penalize you for misusing keywords. So, be very careful.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Short and Long Tail Keywords</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This point is the extension of the second one, but I am writing this separately to emphasizing more. Keywords are king for any content, and the importance of them cannot be neglected. There are two types of keywords: Short-tail keywords and Long-tail Keywords. Short-tail keywords are search maxims with one word, whereas long-tail keywords are phrases with three-four words. Which type is more productive, is crucial to understand. According to SEO experts, the use of Long-tail keyword is more common, and so it should be incorporated into content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Social Media Network</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Having a social media presence helps you achieving more business recognition and customers</a>. In fact, social media is like a breeding ground which should be used wisely. Business owners, sometimes, lack users’ interests and find it difficult to get more conversion. Here in such situation, the platform helps you by providing you more recognition with the help of its 2.8 billion active users.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Email Marketing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With the technological advancement and social media presence, it seems like the use of email is decreasing. However, still, email marketing has its own importance when it comes to solving common problems your business face, such as sales funnel insufficiency and poor lead conversion. This type of marketing helps you a lot. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or ask sales or contributions, and is meant to build devotion, faith, or brand awareness. It is also crucial for building relationships with prospects, leads, and new customers as it gives you a chance to communicate directly to them and convince, in their inbox, at a time that is suitable for them.</p>
<p>Finally, I would say that one who knows even little about the marketing industry cannot refuse the significance of it. The industry is booming and getting more authority on each successive day. In fact, the future also seems more prosperous.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a single person living in this digital era can say ‘NO’ to the importance of Marketing. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">Marketing is compulsory for any business</a>. It is something through which you can make your product well-known in the eyes of the people. Not limited to this, the industry is developing on each successive day. Marketing can be referred as a breeding ground that has opened many doors of success not only for business but also for many folks. But, unfortunately, like many industries, this industry also become a prey of irrelevant myths. So, let’s check out some of the important myths of marketing:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/08/simple-introduction-custom-web-design/">A Simple Introduction To Custom Web Design</a></p>
<p>Myth #1: <strong>Customers Take Your Social Posts for granted</strong></p>
<p>It is not true. Customers read your social content and it also can convince and influence their purchasing decisions. The study reveals, “Nearly 70% of B2C companies and 40% of B2B companies have developed their customer base through social networking sites.” It doesn’t matter much what the social network is, any text, video, image, contest or coupon you publish will get countless eyeballs in this breeding ground with 2.2 billion users.</p>
<p>Myth #2: <strong>Marketing Should Define Future Products&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>It is believed that marketing group allegedly has a grip on what consumers want or prefer in a product or services, as characterized by a list of &#8220;market requirements.&#8221;  Though, in many cases, the marketing group doesn&#8217;t know much about customers’ requirements because of the communication gap. Most of the vendors only know about their current accounts think they want in the future.</p>
<p>Myth #3: <strong>Social media Heals Reputation Wounds</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/how-to-market-a-product">Marketing is all about promoting products to make sales</a>. Not taking care about website feedback is not helpful here. Receiving that outraged Rip-off Report is enough to put an end to your business reputation in search engine results. Each word you say matters a lot and cannot be taken back. In case of any problem, make sure that your social media pages possess active administrators authorized to alleviate any problem immediately, individually and systematically. Well, this myth is true at some extent.</p>
<p>Myth #4: <strong>No need to evaluate social success By Communal Interactions</strong></p>
<p>Sales opportunities or profits should measure the ultimate success you get through social interactions. Interactions may also help you with sales opportunities; but, if you don’t close any of those leads, the campaign will be nothing but a disappointment, regardless of how many interactions were bred. Marketing is about drive higher sales in which evaluation is essential to know which strategy is functional.</p>
<p>Myth #5: <strong>Marketing Costs Nothing</strong></p>
<p>The marketing industry is booming on each successive day. The scope and the benefits your business will get are countless. With such broader scope, the industry plays a vital role in creating employment and also fruitful socio-economic progress. Though the use of social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube are all free to use, hidden costs always exist when applying a social media marketing campaign for most customer boost.</p>
<p>For an active and fetching social media promotion, you need an expert who prioritizes and implements the plan, be able to message, and monitors the mediums for customer response. And it is apparent that he will charge heavy bucks for this job.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Optimize high impact custom websites is crucial to keep people in the know and ready to do their part. Web developers will need to optimize high impact web pages. For convenience, I’ve collected several important tips:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/16/effective-logo-design-tips-professional-business-logo/">Effective Logo Design Tips for Professional Business Logo</a></p>
<h1>1st tip# Create great content</h1>
<p>If you want to rank high in the search engine, then a high content can help you the most. Websites with a fresh, genuine and relevant content are more likely to get a chance to rank. Avoid grammatical mistakes and spelling lower. The question, how long the content should be? must be popping in your mind. Well, there’s no exact answer to it, but it should be at least not smaller than 500 words. In fact, for many, it is good minimum length for a typical blog post.</p>
<p>If we go with research, then it has shown that posts longer than 1000 words tend to rank better. Search engine likes authoritative posts with more than 2000 words. It means, if you want to improve your ranking chances in the future with in-depth articles or blogs, you have to focus on both quality and quantity. The content must be excellent in quality, should be more than 2000 words. So, try to make your writings fun to read, avoid being too much promotional, don’t be boring and assure your content should not look like a legal document. As an alternative, opt for friendly, amusing content.</p>
<h2>2nd tip# Build backlinks to your website</h2>
<p>You need to link your web content with other internal custom web pages. This would be beneficial to your audience, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">will help improve your website’s SEO</a>, make it comfortable for readers to find something useful from your site.</p>
<h2>3rd tip# Optimized URLs</h2>
<p>It will benefit you more if you put keywords in URLs.  Make sure, the keywords you’re putting should be relevant and not inadequate.</p>
<h2>4th tip# Page titles</h2>
<p>Your website’s page must possess compelling and relevant title with some keywords. The title should be descriptive enough to grasp by the readers about the content. For instance, if your blog is about “Effective Logo Designing,” then a great title should be “Effective Logo Designing in ten easy tips” or “<a href="https://www.designhill.com/design-blog/simple-logo-design-recognition/">How to create an effective logo for your business</a>.” However, make sure that your page title should not longer than 70 characters. Although Google will index lengthier page titles, they will be shortened in the search results.</p>
<h2>5th tip# Header tags</h2>
<p>It would be perfect to incorporate the keyword phrase in a header tag, but make sure you’re not spoiling it. The ideal way to include a keyword phrase in a header tag is to use the first heading on the web page as the search engine will pay more attention to H1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6th tip# Make your Professional Web page load faster</h2>
<p>For search engine how much time your website takes in load matters a lot. In fact, it is ranking factor for Google. New case study sheds light that when search engine added website speed into the Algorithm, sites that took more than five minutes to load had to face a severe drop in traffic from search engine. That means fixing page load speed is necessary which can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check how much time your website takes to load.</li>
<li>Optimize your website or web page to improve the overall performance of it.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re using a shared hosting server, you can try switching to a different hosting provider to see if it makes a positive difference. Measure performance again after making changes.</li>
<li>See if your website has any unnecessary things, remove all of them quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow these tips and optimize your high impact web pages.</p>
