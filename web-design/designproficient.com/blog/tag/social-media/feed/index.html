<p>We all are aware of WhatsApp messenger. If we will say that WhatsApp is the most significant source for text and voice messages, then it wouldn’t be wrong. Over millions of people use WhatsApp daily to connect to their relatives and friends. They do voice calls, video calls, group video calls, and many more. It is the most secure communication app.</p>
<p>Many updates have been made to WhatsApp since it was introduced. It has a really funky and unique chats default wallpaper. The update that made people a little bit annoying when the update changed ‘WhatsApp status’ as ‘Bio’ and allow people to share their pictures under ‘Status’ tag. But later, the audience gets comfortable with it.</p>
<p>WhatsApp was first introduced in 2009, and as of now, it has a vast number of users that are almost 2.00 Billion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Facebook is an important platform not only for social interactions but also for businesses</a>. It helps companies to reach their target audience and even to the competitors in the market. Unfortunately, Facebook’s News Feed algorithm is in a continuous state of uncertainty about what should be done.</p>
<p>The platform with more than 2 billion monthly active users, becoming critical or complicated for business owners to control their entrepreneurship and to have a presence on this platform.</p>
<p>If your business needs help staying up to date with the latest Facebook trends or making the most of its reach on the network, then I’ll let you know that it would be tough this time!</p>
<p>Facebook is changing the algorithm that functions the news feed, which presents a computer-curated selection of posts from other people and pages.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/14/6-easy-tips-increase-sales-website/">6 EASY TIPS TO INCREASE SALES ON YOUR WEBSITE</a></p>
<h1>How this new Facebook Algorithm Affect Me and My Business?</h1>
<ul>
<li>This new feed will display things from the people who are important to you than the things that are important for you.</li>
<li>From now, You will see less annoying stuff like fewer click bait and share=like posts, etc., as the new algorithm of Facebook restricts the number of posts, even though they may have many likes and shares, don’t encourage community engagement through conversation.</li>
<li>You will be going to see comparatively less Facebook videos that annoyed you. They will not blast you with fantastic max volume music and overzealous rattling sales pitches.</li>
<li>Your Facebook posts that people comment on will get more views.</li>
<li>You will see more posts from the people you know, or you love. Especially from those friends and family who you talk to the most. This is a step back, though not a full redaction, of a previous update, which began limiting the number of friends’ posts you see on your news feed.</li>
<li>You will see fewer posts and videos about topics you are interested in and more posts from friends you are interested in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your Facebook Business Strategies Will Have To Change:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The persona of your business will be damage, and your business’ voice will lessen down unless you change your Facebook Business Strategies. Here are some of the reasons:</li>
<li>An organic post which is not paid from brand pages and businesses will be shown a smaller amount than they have been in the previous.</li>
<li>Even the bulk amount of Likes and shares will not help your posts as they used to.</li>
<li>The chances are you may have to buy ads to get the same result, but your ads are more likely to perform better than they used to be.</li>
<li>You need some comments on your Facebook posts to achieve the same amount of popularity once you have earlier. This may not be much of a problem for pages with a massive following, but it can hurt small business pages.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Some Important Strategies:</strong></h2>
<h2>Increase your Social Perspectives or Horizons</h2>
<p>You would not waste your precious time with people who don’t like or ignore you. You can find your new friends. No exceptions with social media. Use some of the time you devote to Facebook to explore other options such as Linkedin, Twitter and YouTube are some names.</p>
<h2>Use More Live Video</h2>
<p>In future, Facebook will be presenting not more video to users, but that doesn’t reckon for live video. Live videos are engaging and Facebook like that. It will rank a live video in your business supporters’ feeds.</p>
<h2>Create Engaging Content</h2>
<p>Always remember that Content is king. So, make sure you are <a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/26-ways-to-create-engaging-content/">making a content that is valuable and engaging</a>. In fact, Facebook favor posts that get more eyeballs. You have to write compelling content relevant to the niche. Likes and shares are essential but not the primary factor in post popularity once the change is carried out. You need content that stimulates the commenting type of engagement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.modiphy.com/blog/understanding-social-media-and-social-media-marketing">In the world of marketing social media is like a backbone</a><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">.</a> With almost 4 billion active users worldwide on social media, the platform is being used to fulfill brand needs. But before jumping to the platform or hoping to sell your stuff, take a step back and craft an effective social media strategy first.</p>
<p>So, here is a list of the things you need to do to make your sales boost faster:</p>
<p>ALSO READ:<a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/10/google-starting-choke-organic-traffic/"> IS GOOGLE STARTING TO CHOKE ORGANIC TRAFFIC?</a></p>
<h1>Get More Out Of SMM with Facebook Photo Contest</h1>
<p>If you want to engage your users with your post and generate a lead, then run a photo contest on Facebook. It is a smart way to get more eyeballs. You have to use any reliable app to run a contest in a tab on your page, and prompt your followers to submit photos related to your brand. This practice helps you to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">increase engagement and spread awareness of your Facebook page.</a></p>
<p>Beware about the rules of the Facebook contest. These should not be acceptable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like a page to enter</li>
<li>Share a page to join</li>
<li>Share a page on a friends Timeline to enter</li>
<li>Tag yourself in a photo to enter</li>
<li>Like multiple pages to enter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Run a Facebook Live Campaign</h2>
<p>In the past few years, live streaming is becoming more common. In fact, interacting with the fans can multiply a level of trustworthiness and authenticity to your social media marketing. This could be a live interview to answer the queries of your customers related to your brand; taking live calls or messages; to promote your latest line of products. By doing so, you can drive your audience’s attention in your brand.</p>
<h2>Run a Twitter Poll</h2>
<p>Twitter Poll is one of the less-used features. Running a poll on twitter is an excellent way to get engagement from your customers. They are engaging and a smart way to start a discussion with your followers. The Twitter poll offers you with endless options. They allow followers make decisions for you. So, see how these Polls help your business&#8217;s personality shine.</p>
<h2>Host a Livestream on your Instagram Story</h2>
<p>Instagram is a great platform to capture and share the world&#8217;s moments, Follow other, and discover accounts from all around the globe. This community with over 500 million users has made their live video broadcasting feature available for people. Instagram Livestreaming seems quite similar to Facebook live stream, but there’s some difference– the primary difference is that Instagram videos cannot be stored anywhere, meaning your viewers can only watch when you’re genuinely live. Use Instagram’s live video broadcasting and get creative with it and see how your followers respond! Post consistently</p>
<h2>Post Consistently on YouTube</h2>
<p>Give your viewers an enticement to subscribe to your YouTube channel with the guarantee of a constant strain of high-value content. Frequent posting is essential on YouTube just like other platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Your users will not be as fascinated in your channel if they don’t see you posting not regularly. For driving more traffic to channel, the best trick is to influence the traffic you breed on other platforms. Just feature your new video on your homepage and create a new blog post for it.</p>
<h2>End of the Line</h2>
<p>There you go – five simple tips for your professional social media marketing. I sure hope these tips will help you with your social strategy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently, there are more than two billion users on Facebook. On the other hand, Instagram has around 800 million monthly users. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">With a ranking of such high-value social audiences on these two platforms</a>, you have better chance to find out your desired audience. In fact, today you can see many influencer marketing campaigns accomplished by multiple brands on these platforms &#8212; most of them are successful, fortunately.</p>
<p>Discovering the right influencers on social networks is a great start, but it isn’t the something that acts as a magical weapon. You have to build on or simplify your influencer interactions to guarantee that your campaigns drive brand awareness and ultimately improving your bottom line.</p>
<p>So, here are some indications that your social influencer campaign isn’t working as it ought to be:</p>

<h1>1.    Your Influencer Content Isn’t Reaching Their Viewers</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, Organic reach is falling. If we talk about Facebook, it dropped by 50% during the last year. It is alarming. By this means, your influencer’s content is not reaching to their viewers. In fact, the Instagram influencer’s post can only be view by around 20% of their spectators.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is not the fault of your influencers. They generate valuable content that resonates with the spectators. Our so-called Social media platform is not a “pay to play” thing. The good news is the pay element is a whole lot inexpensive than initiating more influencers.</p>
<p>Think or study how you’re giving support to your influencers. Are you just giving a note to your influencers with the message? Unfortunately, that isn’t enough to do. Instead, generate and share materials that’ll benefit your influencers get a better perceptive of your product. And go crazy with your creativeness.</p>
<h1>2.    Sales or Coupons Are the Only Motivation for Your Audience to Visit</h1>
<p>A long message, like one-time-use coupon or voucher, makes it stress-free for you to generate leads but this will stop coming in once the elevation finishes. Contrariwise, the magnificence of influencers is their ability to associate longstanding.  In fact, discount or a new coupon can weaken your trustworthiness, if they’re being offered every week. Instead, your primary goal should be getting a reliable engagement.</p>
<h1>3.    If Your Current Influencers Are Stopped Delivering</h1>
<p>Influencers, just like the brand or products, have a life cycle, too, it is a tough time for you &#8212; if your influencers aren’t generating the numbers which they used to breed. For such circumstances, pay consideration to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evolution of their niche</li>
<li>Variations in engagement trends</li>
<li>Saturation of their audience</li>
<li>More sponsorships</li>
</ul>
<h1>4.    Your Influencer’s Other Posts Aren’t Appropriate</h1>
<p>It is not something beneficial to think or expect relevancy from your influencers about your product. On the other hand, if your influencer posts about the products feel inappropriate compared to every other piece of their content, it indeed is.</p>
<p>To find the appropriate influencers fit your slot, keep an eye on the following tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out some great influencers who’re excellent at their work. <a href="http://thecoffeedate.com/blog/how-to-collab-on-instagram">Follow them and use Facebook or Instagram proposals to discover some more influencers.</a></li>
<li>Always good to study the competitors’ influencers. By studying them, you get many things more to know.</li>
<li>Be more particular and target the influencers who focus on a specific niche.</li>
<li>Make sure your message matches the influencers.</li>
<li>Get more details through Instagram user-endpoint API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, I would say, try something unique and don’t give up!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media with 3 billion social network users around the world can be used for a range of purposes. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">The platform gives you the perfect opportunity to reach your target audience, build your product and know your rivals in the market.</a></p>
<p>Social media branding is all about the experience audience have with your product virtually. When it’s done correctly, it can and will help you connect to your target market in an ideal way.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we have to bring some little changes in our social media profiles. However, these type of changes come with quite a bit of stress and can be an overwhelming experience. In fact, it can put your online reputation in danger.</p>
<p>To be very honest, rebranding is not an easy task, if not done correctly can end up with a disaster. Proper planning, preparation, and thorough research are the things you must have to do before changing or launching your new Brand web-based social media image</p>
<p>So, let’s begin the journey:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/23/5-awesome-practices-responsive-web-design-professional-web-design-company/">5 AWESOME PRACTICES OF RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN FOR PROFESSIONAL WEB DESIGN COMPANY</a></p>
<h1>Firstly, Why Change the Image of Brand Web-Based Social Media?</h1>
<p>Before going through the process, we should see why we need to change to bring a change:</p>
<ul>
<li>When changing core values of your business</li>
<li>When you observe visuals are not interactive</li>
<li>When you have to reach a new audience</li>
<li>When you’re entering a new market</li>
<li>When you’re changing your product offerings</li>
</ul>
<p>Then,</p>
<h2>1.    Process with Highly-Organized Manner</h2>
<p>For many people, just the mere thought of getting organized can be intimidating. Keeping yourself organized is one of your strengths, it&#8217;s a habit everyone should get into. And here, you cannot ignore the importance of organizing your efforts.</p>
<p>When it comes to rebranding your business in social media, it&#8217;s crucial to realize that you only get one chance at a first impact, and hurrying the process can end up with a serious blunder. Well, thorough-research is your knight in shining armor. So, research everything from the social media platforms to the new expected audience and everything.</p>
<h2>2.    Let Your Audience Know About Your Plans</h2>
<p>Your followers, lovers, and customers should know about each and everything you’re going to do about your business. Not just to avoid panic, also connecting your social media community with your brand, it is crucial. By doing this, you’ll get their recognition, trust and probably their sweet help.</p>
<h2>3.    Research Each Social Media Platforms</h2>
<p>Whether it’s branding or rebranding social media profiles, the thorough research of each platform is a way to shoot. Once you have all your work organized, inform the audience about your plans, it’s time to find out the limitations behind each social media platform that might limit your capacity to change your Brand web-based social media profile. For instance:</p>
<p>Facebook – With 1.86 billion monthly active users, Facebook, is a great medium to market your brand, however, when it comes to rebranding page, this tool is overly defensive. Like, if you have more than 200 likes, you cannot switch your business page name. However, you have to make an entirely new page and in the result losing old followers.</p>
<p>LinkedIn – The rebranding is more complicated and more stringent here. Group profiles can change not more than five times, whereas for changing Company Pages you have to contact the LinkedIn Help Center &#8212; which is the daunting task.</p>
<p>Twitter – Comparatively, it gives you a quick and straightforward solution to change username and profile information.</p>
<h2>4.    Make No Compromise with Professionalism and Consistency</h2>
<p>It is crucial for you to update all your social media profiles on the same day, before your declaration. It will help you to deliver a professional image of your company to the people. To reduce the possibility of misunderstanding, make sure that your messages are consistent across all platforms.</p>
<h2>5.    Remember: It is more than just Changes names</h2>
<p>Of course,<a href="https://moz.com/blog/how-to-rebrand-your-social-media-accounts"> a rebranding is more than just switching names on social media networks</a>. You have to make sure your social media messages are well-aligned with your content, and PR. You also have to answer back to the people reaching out to you.</p>
<p>The goals should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make our followers pleased with the rebrand.</li>
<li>Answer all questions or queries, promptly, about the brand.</li>
<li>Have full coverage for launch.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, these are the things you have to make sure when changing your social media brand image. I hope, all these mentioned content might help you.</p>

<h1>Understand each social media platform</h1>

Photo-sharing app, Instagram has higher engagement rates on posts than any other platform. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Choose the best and relevant platform for your marketing. </a></p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Identify your target audience. Understand their inside out. Do research as much as possible and know who they are, what they do, what makes them feel good, what makes them tick, what they expect, and what they think of you.</p>
<h2>Determine your Goals and Objectives</h2>
<p>Goals are broad, intangible, and abstract whereas objectives are tangible, concrete, and measurable. A good objective should clearly answer what, why, when, where, who, and how. Setting goals and objectives you can improve the overall effectiveness of social media marketing.</p>
<h2>Add Compelling Headlines</h2>
<p>Headlines matter and work significantly in changing the way we think about the content. As most of the readers skim headlines and irrelevant headlines lead you off course. Write headlines first and ask yourself about if they conclude the story if it engages the readers and all. You can also conduct A/B testing to know which headline works more in engaging users.</p>
<p>As Felix Salmon suggests “Even with the most appealing headlines in the world, for every individual who clicks on it, there are hundreds, if not thousands, who see it, absorb it, and simply move on. People get their news from headlines now in a way they never did before.”</p>
<h2>Be Who You Are</h2>
<p>Don’t astray your followers by portraying yourself as a fake personality on social media. Be who you are. Be genuine and reflect your authenticity to the posts.</p>
<h2>Post on the Right Time</h2>
<p>No matter how good your post is, timing matters. If your post is for the right readers and on the right time only then you’ll see results. Schedule your post at the best times without making assumptions. Start with targeting your audience, know them, consider their location, use the right scheduling tools, maintain consistency on posts, continue to test, and keep an eye on the competitors.</p>
<p>So these are six steps to market yourself in social media.</p>

<li>Post compelling content for the people. Do not bore them by talking only about your business. Rather see how you can appealingly convey your brand message without losing their attention. I would rather suggest you go with memes and interactive videos.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Email Marketing</strong></h2>
<p>Another way to convey your brand message to the masses can be email marketing as more than 50% of the earth is using email currently. In fact, the number is projected to reach 2.9 billion users in next few years.</p>
