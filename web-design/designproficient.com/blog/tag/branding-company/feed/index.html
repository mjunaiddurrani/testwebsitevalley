				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American billionaire businessman, Scott Cook says, “A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is – it is what consumers tell each other it is.” This valuable quote alone speaks so much about the significance of a brand and its effect beyond our thoughts. Branding depicts the entire personality, equity and image of the company. From logo design to campaign copy everything has a significant contribution in the company’s ideology, philosophy and core purpose of its message can be understood with the right kind of branding.</p>

<p>Branding is the most powerful aspect of your company therefore you should be very careful about what it looks like and what things it shall reflect to your target market. Sometimes there are minor loopholes in your branding strategy that fail the brand and ultimately cause you to revamp the entire image of your brand all over again. Rebranding your company is a tricky decision that may also be pretty costly and companies who consider about rebranding should keep certain things in mind.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips that will help your business with the decision of rebranding taken righteously!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong>Figure out the need</strong></h1>
<p>– Determining the reason for rebranding is very important. The reason could be just anything but defined. It can be anything that covers a negative reputation that your company might have underwent or your customers simply don’t respond you the way you wanted them to. As the reasons are explored, they help you with a proper plan of rebranding.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Create a Plan</strong></h2>
<p>– For all kinds of decisions in any business, a proper roadmap is highly necessary. Once you have noted down the core points that trigger your mind towards getting a revamp on your company’s brand, you must create a plan of how to start doing it. Rebranding can possibly be started as simply as just changing the color of your company’s logo or twisting its design a bit.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Revamp the Logo </strong></h2>
<p>– <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Redesigning the logo will be the most evident step while rebranding as the logo is the prime identity of any company</a>. It would be good to start with it!</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Modify Packaging</strong></h2>
<p>– If you are a company that sells certain kind of products then changing the package designs could also be an important tip. It is believed that the last and closest campaign that a company runs to reach out their customer is the product packaging so this can possibly be an important tool.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Twist your Ad Campaigns </strong></h2>
<p>– If your brand or company has been using a certain kind of content since forever, then maybe this is the right time to twist that a bit to give a revamped message to your audience.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Do some Customer Research</strong></h2>
<p>– Knowing your customers is good but learning what they need is very important. If you know what are the likes and dislikes of your customers, it becomes easier for you to recreate an image that matches well with their taste. Social Media is a helpful tool that can get you an appropriate response.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Change Brand Colors –</strong></h2>
<p>Playing around with your Brand’s color is a risky but effective approach of rebranding. Brand colors have a special kind of identity associated with your company.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Compare your Brand</strong></h2>
<p>– A sensible comparison between you and your competitors done beforehand can result in a proactive attempt for rebranding. You can learn from the achievements and mistakes made by them.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Think Ahead</strong></h2>
<p>– <a href="https://www.figmints.com/blog/5-companies-that-differentiated-in-crowded-markets-with-brand-strategy/">Your rebranding strategies shall be aligned with your future plans</a>. Thinking ahead vitally shall be a key that you keep in mind while changing the entire brand.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why wait any longer to create and deliver a strong persona of your brand to the customers. Just, work hard from the very beginning and get more eyeballs with your unique brand identity. And for the <a href="https://peartland.com.au/creating-a-unique-brand-identity/">unique brand identity you must have to do something unique</a>, but don’t worry you can take help with the ways I’ve mentioned below.</p>
<p>So, scroll through:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/01/4-symptoms-instagram-facebook-influencer-campaigns-arent-operating/">4 SYMPTOMS YOUR INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK INFLUENCER CAMPAIGNS AREN’T OPERATING</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Be very clear about the goals, ambitions, and capabilities</h1>
<p>It is very crucial to be clear about organization’s goals, ambitions and capabilities. The questions like, what do you want to be and are you really that now? If you are that, how do you deliver a message to your people? It is just important to grasp the business’ current situation, where it wants to be and what it can achieve in coming few years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Understand the customer, and what drives buying in your category and the segment you are pointing</h1>
<p>Another important thing which I think most important is to study your customers. In case if you have no time to take a time-consuming surveys of market and audience, simple hire sales director to ease your workflow. Another option is a proxy, in case if you can’t go to the customers then get a proxy. Just make sure your brand is customer-centric.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Tell an emotional story to your audience</h1>
<p>Emotional and sad stories are two entirely different genres. So, don’t confuse or mix one with other. Your goal is to develop an effective brand identity, and for this, your task should be around the emotions of your customers. Yes, you have to play with their emotions wisely and with love.</p>
<p>Emotional stories excite people more, make them laugh or make them feel inspective. So, you have to create your emotional story. Ask yourself what type of emotion does your brand typically produce from customers? If you are an e-commerce brand, you probably have to say something about the ease of online shopping. Tell stories through video, photo and written content, whatever you think work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Analyze and Refine the Brand Identity</h1>
<p>We all know how tough it can be for a person to create a brand, he has to go through too many technical and daunting tasks. And, it would be so difficult to change it. Once you have established your brand, it is your duty to routinely examine and refine their brand to make sure it&#8217;s delivering on the promises of what the business stands for.</p>
<p>As Raquel Baldelomar said, “<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">One of the benefits of digital advertising is the ability to track, target, and test new strategies and tactics</a>. Your brand identity should not just be a mission statement on the wall and logo. Your brand is a reflection of your chracter, your thinking, and your values’.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s not that difficult to get busy in the day to day workings of your business. You may think that you have less or no time to make your online presence prominent. Many of us feel about content or products as the lifeblood of great brand experiences. But most of us take for granted the <a href="https://www.bluefrogdm.com/blog/brand-strategy-the-top-5-benefits-of-rebranding">importance of having a great design in rebranding.</a></p>
<p>But, why brands need to take a step of rebranding their existing brands?</p>
<p>Being a businessperson, you can have many reasons as to why you want to rebrand your existing business. It will benefit you to list down all your aims and objectives before starting anything or else the idea to rebrand will only run down your business’ image.</p>
<p>When you already know about your objectives you can prepare yourself better and make yourself more attentive towards the act. Some of the good reasons for rebranding could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the existing persona of your company</li>
<li><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Give importance to the new set of brand promotions</a></li>
<li>Deal or recover with the negative image of the business</li>
</ul>

<h1>Here’s why great design matters to your brand:</h1>
<p>No doubt people coming from different backgrounds love things that are well-structured or have an appealing design. Like, a trendy new restaurant will make more customers if it has an enthralling design compared to that one with unappealing designed. In fact, there are many studies which show that great brand design not only makes people cheerier, it also makes them pay more money for your brand.</p>
<p>Like, there are numerous local neighborhood restaurants which have been running successfully for decades and do the fine job without any flashy branding sparkles. They still perform their tasks what people need – offer delicious food and best services.</p>
<h2>Other Reasons: Why Great Design Matters For Rebrand your Brand?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Even dots and dashes matter in your design. If you give importance to details, then you will be perceived as a premium by your customers.</li>
<li>The first impression is the last impression. It is true, and you can create strong experiences. Especially, if you’re a new brand owner.</li>
<li>You can make your customers feel better and as I said above to make them spend more time on your product.</li>
<li>The excellent design ensures your content remains user-friendly and so search friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Lastly, I would say rebranding your existing brand can be equally difficult as branding the first time. Whether you are doing this for the first time or the third time you need to be very careful about every step.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it is 2018, New Year, new things on the way. Many things have transformed and are still changing. The way of thinking about digital marketing also changes with trendy strategies.</p>
<p>After spending hours on research, I’ve compiled seven interesting digital marketing strategies that are expected to be common this year. So go through and choose the best one for your product marketing:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/20/9-really-common-web-design-mistakes-avoid/">9 REALLY COMMON WEB DESIGN MISTAKES TO AVOID</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong> Increase Use of Voice Search</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the increased use of smartphones or tablets, voice search is also increasing. In fact more than 20% of online searches are conducted through voice search and the rate is expected to increase by 50% in coming five years.</p>
<p>Text-based or voice search are equally important and can significantly affect SEO as well other aspects of marketing.</p>
<p>The huge shift from text-based search to the voice search suggests marketers alter or tweak the way they provide information online.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong> Mobile-Friendly Website </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is crucial for your business to possess online existence or visibility in the market. Your business must have a website that should be both mobile and desktop friendly.</p>
<p>We all know how mobile-friendly sites have been becoming important today. In fact, according to the 2018 business stats, more than 60% of search, browsing or sales happen on mobiles.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong> Video Marketing</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Video content strategy is another hot trend of this year. Grabbing your customers’ attention via interactive video has been considered as one of the most successful digital marketing strategies. Two-fourth of the businesses are using video content for marketing and get more than 50% of leads annually.</p>
<p>You have many options in videos from live streaming to explainer videos and Vlog to animation videos. Try to study every video type and choose the most fruitful one according to your brand persona and niche.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong> Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly Artificial Intelligence has been becoming powerful means where <a href="https://digitalagencynetwork.com/what-a-high-ranking-converting-blog-strategy-looks-like/">marketers can expect high growth in their business.</a></p>
<p>The technology has already been impacting our daily lives. Whether it is about automated transportation or taking over dangerous jobs in the world, A.I works everywhere.</p>
<p>In marketing A.I helps you to build a strong relationship with the customers. The technology is being used to grasp customers’ behavior and even helps in decision-making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2><strong> Blog</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No strategy can work more than writing a blog about your brand. If people know who you are, what you are doing, how you’ve struggled, how you’ve launched your brand, then they’ll show more engagement in your product.</p>
<p>Creating a brand’s blog is trendy. I’ve seen many businesspersons writing blogs about their products and getting decent engagements.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2><strong> Social Media Platform</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Social media platform- Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram is being used for marketing purpose. In this year, the use of social media platforms for digital marketing will be given more importance.</p>
<p>Conduct a poll on your product story in Instagram; create and use brand hashtags on every post; go live on Facebook and say something about your business; advertising or paid marketing are some of the things one can do to promote his/her brand.</p>
<p>Lastly, digital marketing is a need of today’s business. Marketers must know ongoing trends through which they can promote business.</p>
