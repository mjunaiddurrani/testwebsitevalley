				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days the most effective way to protect your brand is to create a reputation management plan before something happens. By doing this, the web contains enough good information about you, and you recover a lot faster from any kind of social media holdups that might occur in the future which have a huge impact on the integrity of your brand. The following are some basic steps to take that will help you in devising a reputation management plan for your brand.</p>
<p><strong>Build Your Profile.</strong></p>
<p>You must take some time to out to revisit your existing profiles on social media platforms and upgrade the content so that developed a solid narrative about yourself, your skills, your strengths and your accomplishments. This will help you to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identify how you would like to brand yourself</a>. Then compile a list of where you have worked in the past, what organizations you have belonged to and who your connections have been. All of these entities always have their own public narratives, and this directly reflects on how your customers perceive you.</p>

<p><strong>Gauge Online Sentiment.</strong></p>
<p>You should always focus towards avoiding making assumptions about the current state of your online reputation. You should constantly researching and studying what others are saying, take notes on specific examples, and then draw conclusions about how you are being judged by others online. Most importantly, gauge whether any negative insights have produced measurable reputation or business problems for you.</p>
<p><strong>Devise a Quality Content Plan.</strong></p>
<p>You should think less about the kind of material you want to see about yourself or your areas of expertise and more about what your audience wants to see from you. Ask yourself how the content that you currently have online compares to the content that you need to come up with. Also, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Creative-Copywriting">ask yourself the best way to place your content</a> where your audience will find it. If you need to influence social media networks or use guest posting, then create content that would be easy to share through those venues.</p>
<p><strong>Encourage Positive Reviews</strong></p>
<p>Many people gladly share their positive feedback on their social media profiles or directly on the company&#8217;s Facebook page after a pleasant experience. Surveys and feedback forms are very useful for online businesses to collect reviews. Unfortunately, the response rates for both of these approaches are low. Businesses need to have a strong follow-up mechanism that ensures every customer provides feedback, whether positive or negative. You should not be afraid of negative feedback.</p>
<p>If your reputation strategy is clearly communicated to your entire team and they understand the importance of ensuring greater value, negative feedback will be minimal. Having some negative reviews adds legitimacy to your page and creates a conversation about the brand that raises awareness. Furthermore, how a business handles negative feedback can have a significant impact on its reputation.</p>
