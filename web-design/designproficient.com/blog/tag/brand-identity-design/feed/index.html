				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American billionaire businessman, Scott Cook says, “A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is – it is what consumers tell each other it is.” This valuable quote alone speaks so much about the significance of a brand and its effect beyond our thoughts. Branding depicts the entire personality, equity and image of the company. From logo design to campaign copy everything has a significant contribution in the company’s ideology, philosophy and core purpose of its message can be understood with the right kind of branding.</p>

<p>Branding is the most powerful aspect of your company therefore you should be very careful about what it looks like and what things it shall reflect to your target market. Sometimes there are minor loopholes in your branding strategy that fail the brand and ultimately cause you to revamp the entire image of your brand all over again. Rebranding your company is a tricky decision that may also be pretty costly and companies who consider about rebranding should keep certain things in mind.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips that will help your business with the decision of rebranding taken righteously!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong>Figure out the need</strong></h1>
<p>– Determining the reason for rebranding is very important. The reason could be just anything but defined. It can be anything that covers a negative reputation that your company might have underwent or your customers simply don’t respond you the way you wanted them to. As the reasons are explored, they help you with a proper plan of rebranding.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Create a Plan</strong></h2>
<p>– For all kinds of decisions in any business, a proper roadmap is highly necessary. Once you have noted down the core points that trigger your mind towards getting a revamp on your company’s brand, you must create a plan of how to start doing it. Rebranding can possibly be started as simply as just changing the color of your company’s logo or twisting its design a bit.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Revamp the Logo </strong></h2>
<p>– <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Redesigning the logo will be the most evident step while rebranding as the logo is the prime identity of any company</a>. It would be good to start with it!</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Modify Packaging</strong></h2>
<p>– If you are a company that sells certain kind of products then changing the package designs could also be an important tip. It is believed that the last and closest campaign that a company runs to reach out their customer is the product packaging so this can possibly be an important tool.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Twist your Ad Campaigns </strong></h2>
<p>– If your brand or company has been using a certain kind of content since forever, then maybe this is the right time to twist that a bit to give a revamped message to your audience.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Do some Customer Research</strong></h2>
<p>– Knowing your customers is good but learning what they need is very important. If you know what are the likes and dislikes of your customers, it becomes easier for you to recreate an image that matches well with their taste. Social Media is a helpful tool that can get you an appropriate response.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Change Brand Colors –</strong></h2>
<p>Playing around with your Brand’s color is a risky but effective approach of rebranding. Brand colors have a special kind of identity associated with your company.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Compare your Brand</strong></h2>
<p>– A sensible comparison between you and your competitors done beforehand can result in a proactive attempt for rebranding. You can learn from the achievements and mistakes made by them.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Think Ahead</strong></h2>
<p>– <a href="https://www.figmints.com/blog/5-companies-that-differentiated-in-crowded-markets-with-brand-strategy/">Your rebranding strategies shall be aligned with your future plans</a>. Thinking ahead vitally shall be a key that you keep in mind while changing the entire brand.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why wait any longer to create and deliver a strong persona of your brand to the customers. Just, work hard from the very beginning and get more eyeballs with your unique brand identity. And for the <a href="https://peartland.com.au/creating-a-unique-brand-identity/">unique brand identity you must have to do something unique</a>, but don’t worry you can take help with the ways I’ve mentioned below.</p>
<p>So, scroll through:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/01/4-symptoms-instagram-facebook-influencer-campaigns-arent-operating/">4 SYMPTOMS YOUR INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK INFLUENCER CAMPAIGNS AREN’T OPERATING</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Be very clear about the goals, ambitions, and capabilities</h1>
<p>It is very crucial to be clear about organization’s goals, ambitions and capabilities. The questions like, what do you want to be and are you really that now? If you are that, how do you deliver a message to your people? It is just important to grasp the business’ current situation, where it wants to be and what it can achieve in coming few years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Understand the customer, and what drives buying in your category and the segment you are pointing</h1>
<p>Another important thing which I think most important is to study your customers. In case if you have no time to take a time-consuming surveys of market and audience, simple hire sales director to ease your workflow. Another option is a proxy, in case if you can’t go to the customers then get a proxy. Just make sure your brand is customer-centric.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Tell an emotional story to your audience</h1>
<p>Emotional and sad stories are two entirely different genres. So, don’t confuse or mix one with other. Your goal is to develop an effective brand identity, and for this, your task should be around the emotions of your customers. Yes, you have to play with their emotions wisely and with love.</p>
<p>Emotional stories excite people more, make them laugh or make them feel inspective. So, you have to create your emotional story. Ask yourself what type of emotion does your brand typically produce from customers? If you are an e-commerce brand, you probably have to say something about the ease of online shopping. Tell stories through video, photo and written content, whatever you think work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Analyze and Refine the Brand Identity</h1>
<p>We all know how tough it can be for a person to create a brand, he has to go through too many technical and daunting tasks. And, it would be so difficult to change it. Once you have established your brand, it is your duty to routinely examine and refine their brand to make sure it&#8217;s delivering on the promises of what the business stands for.</p>
<p>As Raquel Baldelomar said, “<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">One of the benefits of digital advertising is the ability to track, target, and test new strategies and tactics</a>. Your brand identity should not just be a mission statement on the wall and logo. Your brand is a reflection of your chracter, your thinking, and your values’.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s not that difficult to get busy in the day to day workings of your business. You may think that you have less or no time to make your online presence prominent. Many of us feel about content or products as the lifeblood of great brand experiences. But most of us take for granted the <a href="https://www.bluefrogdm.com/blog/brand-strategy-the-top-5-benefits-of-rebranding">importance of having a great design in rebranding.</a></p>
<p>But, why brands need to take a step of rebranding their existing brands?</p>
<p>Being a businessperson, you can have many reasons as to why you want to rebrand your existing business. It will benefit you to list down all your aims and objectives before starting anything or else the idea to rebrand will only run down your business’ image.</p>
<p>When you already know about your objectives you can prepare yourself better and make yourself more attentive towards the act. Some of the good reasons for rebranding could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the existing persona of your company</li>
<li><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Give importance to the new set of brand promotions</a></li>
<li>Deal or recover with the negative image of the business</li>
</ul>

<h1>Here’s why great design matters to your brand:</h1>
<p>No doubt people coming from different backgrounds love things that are well-structured or have an appealing design. Like, a trendy new restaurant will make more customers if it has an enthralling design compared to that one with unappealing designed. In fact, there are many studies which show that great brand design not only makes people cheerier, it also makes them pay more money for your brand.</p>
<p>Like, there are numerous local neighborhood restaurants which have been running successfully for decades and do the fine job without any flashy branding sparkles. They still perform their tasks what people need – offer delicious food and best services.</p>
<h2>Other Reasons: Why Great Design Matters For Rebrand your Brand?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Even dots and dashes matter in your design. If you give importance to details, then you will be perceived as a premium by your customers.</li>
<li>The first impression is the last impression. It is true, and you can create strong experiences. Especially, if you’re a new brand owner.</li>
<li>You can make your customers feel better and as I said above to make them spend more time on your product.</li>
<li>The excellent design ensures your content remains user-friendly and so search friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Lastly, I would say rebranding your existing brand can be equally difficult as branding the first time. Whether you are doing this for the first time or the third time you need to be very careful about every step.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The logo is a face of the brand that explains what your brand is. Designing a right logo can lead your business towards success. Logo designing is not an easy task; it requires strong research about the ongoing and even upcoming tends.</p>
<p>Following are the five essential tips to know for crafting a killer logo:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/02/27/8-effective-seo-tips-rank-beginner-website/">8 effective SEO tips to rank beginner website</a></p>
<h1>Identify your brand</h1>
<p>The logo is an explanation of your business that should be potent enough to communicate with the targeted audience. Therefore, it should possess all the elements of the business that are mandatory to be delivered to the audience. List the things about your brand and especially its ideology. Link your ideologies with symbols and elements that best convey your brand`s message and use these elements smartly to create a logo. Be precise, use hidden clues and follow ‘less is more strategy’.</p>
<h2>Color’s psyche</h2>
<p>Remember your brand’s logo is not just a small colorful image. In fact, it involves a whole psyche of colors behind each element. Color psyche is vital to know in <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">logo designing</a>.  Some shades of colors are considered as harsh while some are cool. According to the color theory, the red color is considered as energetic while the orange shade produces friendly or youthful vibes. Yellow is used for cheerfulness, and the green color is for instructional purposes. The blue tones are used in professional or medical product logo.  Purple is for spirituality, black demonstrates power, white reflects simplicity, whereas pink color is commonly used in toys or other babies’ stuff. So try to opt the most appropriate color as per your business nature and customers psyche.</p>
<h2>Timelessness</h2>
<p>Timelessness matters a lot. Because you’re crafting a logo that will stay for years. So, try to come up with a design that is productive enough to interact with the people of not only today but tomorrow. Study deeply about the social transformations; how choices are changing, what are the values of people and other social trends. While studying the present design trends, try to predict the upcoming trends and make your logo accordingly.</p>
<h2>Thorough Research</h2>
<p>Research is mandatory in every aspect of designing to get success, including <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/02/the-ultimate-guide-to-logo-design/">logo designing.</a> Even the brands with the big name have their separate research team that is responsible for brief market trends, social aspects, market drifts, risk factors, etc. They study audience, their preferences, brand’s competitors, company’s long-term goals and every single aspect of the business that helps logo to stand out from the others.</p>
<p>Most of the start-up companies do not possess separate research panels for designing a logo.Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn`t. But it would be nearly impossible for the logo to fail to grab attention if all the aspects were thoroughly-researched.</p>
<h2>Simplicity and minimalism</h2>
<p>Try to keep logo as simple as possible because your logo will be used everywhere – from site to pamphlets or even from shoes to clothes. The heavy ornamentations, large fonts, clashing colors schemes can ruin your logo.</p>
<p>Consider popular logo designs too, and see how the simplicity works. One of the best examples of simplicity is NIKE, we all know how famous the logo is and how simple it is. It is a perfect example of minimalism approach while creating a logo. On the other hand, complicated logo designs are less likely preferable because complex logos are tough to identify. They are less memorable and less appealing.</p>
<p>Lastly, remember your logo is your brand’s identification. Follow mentioned tips to make a killer logo.</p>

<h1> SWOT</h1>
<p>Create a plan before pitching anything to your clients. Your small mistake can ruin your image in the market and can make you suffer a lot. SWOT analysis of your idea can help you understand the strength and weaknesses. You can calculate the risk of failure and can redesign your strategy for better results.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Keeping an eye on your goal is the right way to stand in the market.

Then market your brand in a way that your message and best features of your product reach the maximum number of relevant audience. Prepare a  probability graph to calculate ROI of your plan and act accordingly.</p>
<h2>Minimalism</h2>
<p>Extra is not the trend of the market now. <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/minimalism-growth/">Minimalism is the phenomenon</a> of pitching and presenting what is required only. Rather than wasting your time, money and energy on extra ornamentations its good to organize and manage what is important. From the name of your brand till the <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">website design</a> try to hold the approach of minimalism. Simple brand name, logo, packaging, website design, and advertisements are more impactful because they are easy to understand.</p>
<h2>Utilize Maximum Resources</h2>
<p>To market your brand and to add value to it, you can use several platforms at a time to hit the most number of targeted audience. It is not necessary to always focus on paid marketing and advertisements, your marketing plan must include free and easy assessable options as well. For example, social media account management, promotions, and sales for regular followers of the page, V-log, product tutorials etc. Try to utilize most of the available sources so that you can spread your brand more and more within less time.</p>
<h2>Show Your Presence</h2>
<p>Active participation to show your existence helps customers to trust your brand. You can set high positions in the market by grabbing people`s attention at events and celebrations. Your active presence on your social media pages, quick responses for queries of people and visibility in special events will make people think about your brand every time they will be buying certain products or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, you will follow the mentioned techniques to build your brand more effectively and to expand your sales graph.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever visited a website or a social media page and immediately felt like you have to leave? We’ve been there. Have you ever looked at a badly designed ad and felt disgusted rather than feeling attracted to it? We’ve been there as well. This is partially because of bad web page aesthetics or in laymen terms, it has a bad design flow.</p>
<h2><strong>What is design flow?</strong></h2>
<p>Design flow is the movement of your eyes on a specific design document. In some places, it also refers to design consistency such as color, images, line height and much more. From web design to ad design, your brand’s beauty is defined by the design flow on the document.</p>
<p>Design flow is the basic understanding of how your users digest the content that you show them. It might sound easy to do but it actually isn’t. Pairing and working hard with the eye movement and understanding the basic ideas of design flow is what you need to pay attention to if you want your design to prosper.</p>

<h2><strong>Importance of verbal and visual flow</strong></h2>
<p>The best design is made up of two essential elements: the first being verbal flow and the second being visual flow. Both verbal and visual flow combine to create excellent design flow. The verbal flow usually refers to the order in which user reads text on your website. This includes eye movement, font used, line height, line length etc. and more.</p>
<p>The visual flow on the other hand refers to the order at which the user looks at the images on the page, the advertisement or any sort of design that you’ve worked on. Together, both verbal and visual flow contribute to excellent results and that’s where you come in.</p>
<p>All in all, working on both of these significant elements can combine to create excellent and outstanding results for your design flow and of course, for your website as well. Work on your flow today or if you need professional help, reach us at The Web Founders.</p>
