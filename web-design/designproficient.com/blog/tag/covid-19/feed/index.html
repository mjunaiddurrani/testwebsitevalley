				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently, this is not a normal time in which the whole world is suffering. COVID-19 (Coronavirus) has erupted in millions of people worldwide. Many people have lost their families and increasingly try to feed themselves and their families. For many of us, the future is uncertain. If we have learned something in the past few months, mutual support is the best part of the web design industry.</p>
<h3>Letâ€™s Talk About Web Design Industry</h3>
<p>As the novel coronavirus carries on to spread globally, the website development or design companies and freelancers must be aware of its impact on business and organize accordingly. Coronavirus pandemics are a threat to freelancers and <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">web design companies</a> and their employees, not only from a well-being perception but also from an economic perspective. With the global economy in a difficult time, more and more people are limited to working from home.</p>
<p>The current state of COVID-19 has had a significant economic impact on the business and technology sectors of the public and private sectors. Not only in certain areas in about 100 countries but also personal life.</p>
<p>The official report confirmed that, as in other sectors, the impact on the economy is expected to dropping to -13%, contracting 1.7% next year, and slowing growth in the first two quarters of this year.</p>
<h3>Significant Impact on Supply Chain</h3>
<p>With rapid growth, now is the right time for technology and web development companies to reduce risk and design solutions. The virus caused delays in some essential meetings related to large-scale technology and web development that had a significant impact on business. As the number of confirmed cases worldwide increases, the results will be much more complicated than expected. There is no doubt that people are trying to work at their location, but due to delays in planning and collaboration opportunities, they are still unable to provide accurate results.</p>
<h3>Impact on Productivity and Performance</h3>
<p>In general, the virus has a significant impact on employee productivity and performance, because it is challenging to adjust targets for bonuses, sales, and coincidences when employees are working from home. Daily productivity and performance manipulation are key issues. The most severe loss is for SMEs, who cannot use telework spaces properly. As a result, the company has renounced these employees and reduced salaries. This also has a major impact on the entire business and production.</p>
<h3>How to Cope With This Pandemic:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Website designers need to figure out a way to curtail costs. Consider meeting with new or existing customers on the internet to reduce travel costs and gas charges.</li>
<li>Since web designers and developers have fewer clients these days due to coronavirus threats, they can invest their free time to learn new skills and increasing their knowledge.</li>
<li>Digital platforms working with famous brands are less vulnerable to small and medium-sized businesses. Working with these platforms is an excellent way to increase corporate leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>&#8220;We all suffering from this pandemic, so stay safe, everyone, stay home&#8221;</strong></em></p>
