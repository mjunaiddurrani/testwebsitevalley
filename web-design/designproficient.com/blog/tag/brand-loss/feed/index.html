				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a regular follower of our blog, you of all people understand what we’ve stressed over from time to time. A brand is undoubtedly the voice of a company. It’s the visual character that interacts with the customers of the company. However, where this brand is connected with the profit of the company, it is also connected to the loss of the company. What people also don’t realize is that the loss of a brand is far worse than the loss of a company or an entity. Allow us to explain how brand loss works.</p>

<h2><strong>So, What is Brand Loss?</strong></h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, brand loss and company loss is not the same thing. The loss of a company basically refers to loss in shares of a corporate entity working in the background. Loss in trade and/or shares are great examples of what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Brand loss, however, refers to loss in followers, loss in engagement, loss in customer loyalty and the list goes on. How are both of these things any different? Well, when the loss of a company occurs, it can be handled easily. The loss in shares or trade occurs in the background and does not have any effect on the reputation of the whole entity. However, brand loss directly relates to continuous loss in the company. What this means is that during a brand loss the loss doesn’t stop at a point and continues to grow since it’s a direct hit on the company.</p>
<h2><strong>Sustaining Brand Loss </strong></h2>
<p>There are several ways to sustain brand loss. One of the most proven ways to sustain brand loss is to work on the overall current existence of the brand. This is partly where a brand revamp can help out the most. In addition, complete brand shifts can be helpful as well. If a brand is continuously providing loss to the company, it might be time to invest in a new brand.</p>
<p>Advertising and revamping the brand completely is undoubtedly the right option to save yourself from the wrath of such a loss. If not controlled, this loss can even go on to become the resulting factor to shutting down a working entity. Want to share your take on brand loss? Share it with us in the comment section below.</p>
