<h2>Visual design</h2>
<p>The visual design aims to deliver a clear-cut message to the audience by using optical elements such as colors, images, and symbols. It helps represents the better dynamic look and feel of the front-end user interface and also known as graphic design, user interface design, and the communication design.</p>
<h2>Information architecture</h2>
<p>Information architecture is a user experience design element and helps in systemizing and organizing valuable contents for a website. It makes more accessible for a user to navigate through a site and find the proper functionality of a website structure.</p>
<h2>User experience research</h2>

<h2>Input control</h2>
