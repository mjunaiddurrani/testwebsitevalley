				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike paid traffic, <a href="https://www.smartbugmedia.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-direct-and-organic-search-traffic-sources">organic traffic refers to non-paid traffic</a>. It includes traffic from search engines, social media sites, referral traffic, and direct traffic. These are the traffic achieved organically, rather than any source of paid promotion or advertising.</p>
<p>Publishing the relevant and high-quality content on blog and website is one way to boost the organic traffic of your site. This is, in fact, most comfortable and functional technique used for obtaining new visitors on the website. SEO &#8211; search engine optimization is the outlet of online marketing that emphases directly on cultivating and boosting organic traffic.</p>
<p>Now, let’s suppose that Google is starting to choke organic traffic and limiting the visitors that can get to a site after searching. What would happen, then?</p>
<p>It’s not daydreaming. It&#8217;s happening now. Doubting how? Here’s how.</p>

<h1>The Knowledge Graph</h1>
<p>Since the establishment, The Knowledge Graph has been getting more popularity. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Google is using the Knowledge Graph to enhance its search engine’s services</a> with information collected from a variety of sources. Moreover, this refers to Google’s central database of information on movies, historical events, locations, and other topics; when a user searches any topic, a box on the right-side of the search engine results page will display relevant information to that topic along with links to Google pages for other related topics.</p>
<p>Now, it can be a long debate with a lot of confusions about whether The Knowledge Graph really steals organic traffic or not. No matter what, it is clear that anyone looking for his needed information in these boxes doesn’t require to click a link for any more information.</p>
<h1>Carousels</h1>
<p>What is Carousel? How it links with Google? To make sure a perfect web experience delivers to all its users. Google offers Carousel, the most valuable improvement which takes local search to the next level. Google carousels help people with information. It is quite similar to the concept of Knowledge Graph. Both tend to help users. For instance, if anyone searches for ‘Rampage,’ He’ll come up with individual entries for Dwayne Johnson, Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman, Jake Lacy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and some other stuff related to his search. Now, every single entry links to another page with more specific information on each cast. Let’s say, the biography, the career, the rewards and the list is endless. Principally, it’s another doorway that makes the Knowledge Graph more influential – while making it less likely, users need to visit external websites to find the information they’re eyeing for.</p>
<h1>Videos and Content</h1>
<p>Search engines like GOOGLE, YAHOO, and BING offer text-based and visual content which people is searching for. Especially Google assures with its videos and content offerings to fulfill people search requirements. By guaranteeing this, Google makes its ownership of YouTube treasured. Users also get engage with content without going on to any other web page.</p>
<p>These are only three things I’ve mentioned; there’re many other things which screaming loudly that Google is taking a step to keep users on Google for an extended period (as long as possible) by offering them required answers on their queries.</p>
<p>Somehow, it is the critical or tensing situation, but that doesn’t apply that one should have to lessen down his investment in search engine optimization. Don’t worry, Google cannot provide everything to its users.</p>
