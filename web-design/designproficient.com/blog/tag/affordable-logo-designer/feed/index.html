<h1><strong>1.  </strong><strong>Go With Plan </strong></h1>
<p>Always go with planning. Pre-planned things are more likely to succeed than unplanned things. Make sure you are planning each thing properly. How your logo should be, what customers will be its targeting, what message it will convey, how flexible it should be, and there are countless things need to be planned.</p>
<h2><strong>2.  </strong><strong>Don’t Fall For Premade Custom Logos, Hire an Expert</strong></h2>
<p>That’s completely fine if you know not much about logo designing since you are an entrepreneur, not a designer. There’s always a good alternative. Hire an expert designer who knows basic to advance principles of designs, color psychology, and possesses years of experience in the reputable organization.</p>
<p>Commonly, many people have been seen going for a premade logos. Premade or ready-made logos are not appropriate for your business. They are not unique and so should not be used.</p>
<h2><strong>3.  </strong><strong>Don’t Complicate, Make It Simple</strong></h2>
<p>Things if not simple, will sucks – to you and to your customers who are speculating on your logo and have lots of expectations from you. It is not good in any way to make them angry and confused. In fact, the purpose of the logo is to convey brand’s message. If they are multifaceted, they will not serve their primary goal.</p>
<h2><strong>4.  </strong><strong>Avoid Unnecessariness, Incorporate Only Needed Things</strong></h2>
<p>This point is an extension of them &#8211;. With simplicity, it meant to incorporate only things your logo needs or you think essential to add. Take a paper and pen out. Write about your business—what your business is about, who your customers are, what they do, and all. Write five two-three lines on each and then summarize. Hand over this summary to your designer and ask him to incorporate them as much as possible. Heavy ornaments, loud color tones, excessive text are the things can make your design meager.</p>
<h2><strong>5.  </strong><strong>Get Some Inspiration</strong></h2>
<p>The present market is overflowing with a number of good-to-inspire logo designs. Why not take some inspiration and take a hold of the good things from them? Research the market, get some good logo designs to see, study them and take inspiration for your coming business logo. By inspiration, it doesn’t mean to steal their work.</p>
<h2><strong><u>Last Thought</u></strong></h2>
<p>The logo is crucial for your business. Make it stand out and noticeable. Make your business well-known in the eyes of the public and get more sales. Directly or indirectly, it all starts with your logo, so don’t compromise with its eminence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether your business is about medicine, food, sport or anything else. It does not matter what the nature of your business is – it is crucial to design logos in timeless and memorable manner. <a href="https://www.bluesodapromo.com/blog/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-logo-design/">For designing a logo, it is important to understand certain things</a>. Every single line, shape, color, and form are important in making a conscious decision when it comes to design a logo for your business.</p>
<p>So, in this blog, I’ll talk about the important concept – a Figure-Ground relationship that will help you create a timeless business logo. Let’s look what it’s all about!</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/13/design-matters-rebrand-brand/">WHY DESIGN MATTERS FOR REBRAND YOUR BRAND</a></p>
<h1>SO, WHAT IS FIGURE-GROUND RELATIONSHIP IN CUSTOM LOGO FOR YOUR BUSINESS?</h1>
<p>Figure and ground are two terms with different meanings. The figure refers to the positive space in the logo design. Whereas, ground refers to the background or negative space in the emblem. Commonly, a logo is visually prevailing in the figure. Sometimes, the elements of the figure are ground dominating instead of being figure dominant.</p>
<h2>WHY THE CONCEPT IS IMPORTANT FOR CUSTOM LOGO DESIGNERS?</h2>
<p>When it comes to the importance of Figure-Ground relationship in logos, look Gestalt Principle. It will tell you that design is perceived as a unified whole. Figure-Ground Relationship is an extension of the Gestalt Principle.</p>
<p>When people view a logo, they see individual elements and categorize it in relationships. It means negative space is equally important as positive space because both spaces exist in relation and depend on each other.</p>
<h2>KINDS OF FIGURE GROUND RELATIONSHIPS:</h2>
<p>There are three types of figure-ground relationships. These are:</p>
<h2>1.    Constant Figure-Ground Relationship:</h2>
<p>This type allows a person to differentiate a ground and figure in the logo design easily. For making logo stable enough, the designer has to make one thing dominant over other. For instance, they can make negative space more prominent over positive space in the design.</p>
<h2>2.    Reversible Figure-Ground Relationship</h2>
<p>Both figure and the ground get equal attention in this type. In such design, there is space for the ground to take over the figure and for the figure to take over the ground. By doing so, it creates a sort of ambiguity.</p>
<h2>3.    Ambiguous Figure-Ground Relationship</h2>
<p>This type of relationship makes it quite difficult for spectators to separate ground from the figure in design. In such designs, viewers cannot detect a focal point. Although, it is ideal for creating patterns in the logo.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE THE CONCEPT IN DESIGNING</h2>
<p>So, if you want to create distinct figure ground relationships in the logo, here is what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create stark figure-ground distinction by using contrasting colors. Using warm colors against a cool and cool against a warm background you can create a compelling contrast. This is especially helpful for users to recognize and read the text.</li>
<li>Make the ground non-existent in your logo, so that figure in design dominates the ground. You need to amplify and prominent the figure elements so that the ground becomes insignificant.</li>
<li>A blurred background acts well against a text. It is another way to make the figure-ground relationship blatant. In fact, it is a key technique in filmmaking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>END OF THE LINE</h2>
<p>So, these are the things you should consider about <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">making your business logo according to the figure-ground relationship concept</a>.</p>
