<h1>Choose Specific Topic for Site</h1>
<p>Pick any one topic and try to stick with it.  You cannot appeal every other person. The same goes for the website. Therefore, the designer should focus on targeted audience and one topic. Think about your website’s purpose, choose the specific topic, set target audience demographics and make your site accordingly.</p>
<h2>Use Keywords Wisely</h2>
<p>Keywords are the king, serves the important purpose. But the wise use of keyword can only help you with your site ranking. That particular thing of your site (the topic of the site) should be mentioned where they matter; in title and description. The designer should also add keywords not only in texts but on the images. H1, H2, H3 are just not headings but have other functions as well. They can change the game of keyword settings.</p>
<h2>Add Backlinks to the page</h2>
<p><a href="https://yoast.com/successful-linkbuilding-strategy/">Link-building is another strategy</a> that works. You should add links of other relevant pages on your web page. Adding backlinks to the page help you increase the site rankings.</p>
<h2>Avoid Unnecessary Content</h2>
<p>Delays in page loading can be harmful to the site because if users find any difficulty in loading they will quickly switch to any other website. So, while designing a website just be careful about the addition of non-essential things. Enormous visual content, too much content and even unnecessary plugins can be a reason for the delay while loading a website.</p>
<h2>Update Regularly</h2>
<p>Update your site frequently because if your website’s content is getting older then it is also losing a chance of ranking. Most of the companies update their sites just to ensure if they get a better chance of ranking.</p>
<p>Fresh content is a fuel of the site, which not only renews your site but also works well for social media as people want to read and share new content and eventually benefits<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing"> SEO.</a></p>
<h2>Use Genuine and Quality Content</h2>
<p>The designer should prefer quality content instead of stealing others material. Stealing content is easy and a quick way to start a business website but it can ruin your investment as well. Copied content is not SEO friendly and Google marks it as spam.</p>
<p>Add unique articles or blogs, use the interactive visual content to appeal visitors. Even site with unique content is 50% more likely to get chance of getting more visitors than the site without genuine content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Make your site Easy-to-navigate for the visitors</h2>
<p><a href="https://bemorewithless.com/simplicityblogs/">Minimalism and simplicity</a> are the two things that designer should keep in mind while designing. If your site is simple, users will find no difficulty in navigation. Define each category or sub-category clearly for the users. Add ‘Call to action’ to the site – a phrase that eases viewers to take immediate action, it could be; call us, message us, add to the cart, subscribe now.</p>
<h2>Forget black hat SEO and Prefer White hat SEO</h2>
<p>Use white hat SEO tactics if you want your site to be rank for long on the Google. Even using tactics like article spinning, reporting competitors’ page considered as an illegal, against to the SEO rules that surely ruin your site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building a website that stand-alone in the market is a dream of every new designer. But it is not just the matter of knowing few coding, rather you also have to focus on Site’s SEO too.</p>
