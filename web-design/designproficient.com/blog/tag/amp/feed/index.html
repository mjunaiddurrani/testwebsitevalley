When we open a website on the desktop it loads comparatively faster than our cell phones. It is because your desktops have supportive programs. Also, RAM and memory are more than that of mobiles.

<p><em>“The median load time for AMP is 0.7 seconds, the time it takes for your eye to blink twice. By contrast, the median load time for non-AMPs is 22.0 seconds, the time it takes for you to leave the site and never come back.”</em></p>
