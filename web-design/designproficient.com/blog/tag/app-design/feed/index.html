				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people landing on your website, they do not spend more than five seconds to decide whether to move further or not. Therefore, investing in UX is considered as necessary to gain trust, brand recognition and guarantee user preservation.</p>
<p>For respective purpose you have to follow several technique, some of which I’ve mentioned bellow</p>

<h1>UNIFORM DESIGN</h1>
<p>Once you have decided the design of your application or website, stick on it until the end. Make sure the design you have picked must possess consistency and uniformity. The user should be not get confused in website, whether it is about typography, color or anything. The bold typography with compelling color get more eyeballs and the thing which make them more attracted is consistency. It is your task to be consistent with the aesthetics and construction throughout the development of the app.</p>
<h2>VISUAL HIERARCHY OF CONTENTS</h2>
<p>With uniformity and consistency, also maintain hierarchy or balance in visual contents. The design of the text and icons without including empty spaces inside should be your first option. Maintaining the visual hierarchy is important as it delivers users comfortable experience of readability.</p>
<h2>PERSONALIZE THE UX</h2>
<p>Personalization is when the behavior of past visits is recorded by an app, and stored for retargeting determinations. If a user has specific buying patterns, you can provide them with proposals and deals to assist them with their purchasing decisions. Personalization offers more unique and relevant user experience. The more aligned the experience is with a user’s requirements and inclinations, the <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/App-Design-and-Development">more likely they are to continue to use the application.</a></p>
<h2>OFFER ASSISTANCE</h2>
<p>Offer your users assistance within the app by providing different support options. Users will often search for help in the toolbar or tab bar of an app. Offer multiple ways for users to receive support, including self-serve FAQs and live support through click-to-call buttons.</p>
<h2> QUALITATIVE DATA</h2>
<p>So, you are working really hard on your design and want to examine the effectiveness of your efforts. For that traditional and free analytics are should not be your choice. I will tell you both qualitative and quantitative data are equally important in order to fully grasp your UX and pinpoint opportunities for optimization. Qualitative data allow you to visualize what is actually going on inside your app and how your user behaviors. This way you can improve user experience.</p>
<h2>TRANSPARENCY TO SHARING OPTIONS</h2>
<p>Today, many of are more comfortable of sharing personal <a href="https://www.hswsolutions.com/services/mobile-web-development/mobile-website-vs-apps/">information on devices such as mobile and within apps</a>. It increased concerns about how that data is kept, shared and used.</p>
<p>So, to establish more trustworthy relationship with your users, explain precisely what they’re sharing and with whom. No users want their private content shared on social networks without their awareness or consents, and if that occurs, you’ll not just lose trust, you’re probably also getting a negative review, which has additional downstream effects.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a fashion app or website, do not dare to assume that people on your app will robotically want to share their styling ideas or progress with their Facebook or LinkedIn community. Instead, make sure to offer a variety of sharing choices for your users that they can switch on and off at-will.</p>
<p>So, these are some of techniques you must use to make your users feel like they’re in a right place when they come to your website.</p>
