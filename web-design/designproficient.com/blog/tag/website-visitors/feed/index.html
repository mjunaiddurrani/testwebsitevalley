				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launching a website is the only half route towards online business, the other half is to bring potential customers to your website and stop the audience from driving away. Many small budget and simple sites can keep customers intact whereas many high budget websites are a total flop. The reason lies within the website design and development.</p>
<p>Here are six ways of driving customers away from a website and if your website is following any such pattern it’s time to change to earn more and more happy customers.</p>

<h1>URL is too complicated or misleading</h1>
<p>Complicated URLs never let the audience find your website while searching something of Google. URLs with numbers or tricky name, confusing spelling considered as least professional or tacky. Misleading URLs also play a role in confusing clients, and they don&#8217;t click BUY NOW button.</p>
<h1>Haphazard Landing Page</h1>
<p>Landing page with incorrect and unclear information is the biggest reason for leaving a website right ahead without checking out further information and company`s message. Landing page image and video are the two best chances to attract visitors and provoke them to visit service page or inventory of any website. When images are unorganized, information is not worthy, and the content is chaotic the visitors leave the site within 10 to 15 seconds.</p>
<h1>Pop-ups</h1>
<p>One or two pop-ups are fine, but too many pop-ups are exasperating and annoying. Useless and irrelevant pop-ups will drag the customer’s attention to something else, and many of them will shift to other <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">websites</a>.</p>
<h1>Grammar Errors in Content</h1>
<p>Grammar errors show the unprofessionalism and non-serious attitude of your company. Write simple and straightforward content with no grammar issues rather than finding quality in complex and long sentences.</p>
<h1>Complex Vocabulary</h1>
<p>No one will pay time to check for synonyms before placing an order on a website that’s why complex and rarely used vocabulary will only irritate people by not letting them understand your message. With poor message deliverance, the chances of getting good business are not possible.</p>
<h1>Auto-Music or Video</h1>
<p>Believe it or not auto music and video is a real pain. Firstly, out of nowhere something starts to play no matter you want to watch it or not. Secondly, it increases loading time, and in case of slow internet people can’t scroll or check other pages because of auto pay mode. Usually among multiple tabs, if something unnecessarily starts playing something people without giving a single look to website close that particular tab.</p>

<h1>HIGHLIGHT YOUR CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTONS ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h1>
<p>Placing a call to action on your website is not tough, but putting them in the right place is essential. Build your CTA wisely to get more eyeballs of visitors and induce them to click. Offer your visitors things that they can&#8217;t refuse.</p>
<p>The call to action, better known as the “CTA,” is an appeal to visitors, inviting their response on a webpage, acting as an indication that guides the user through the next steps. If your call to action is not clear enough then the user may not know the following steps to take to purchase a product or sign up for a newsletter. In many cases, visitors leave the website without completing their task.</p>
<h2>USE TWITTER FOR LEAD GENERATION ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h2>
<p>The platform works almost for every business. The task is just to discover the right people and engaging them, which can be as simple as following them or taking part in a conversation. For the respective purpose, you can find people using Twitter search with relevant hashtags or keywords, or use LinkedIn to find specialists. You can also take help with some tools like CrowdFire or Followerwonk. The entire process requires a significant amount of time, but if done wisely, can produce prominent consequences. Of course, you have to link your twitter account with your website.</p>
<h2>TEST, TEST, TEST</h2>
<p>One cannot overlook the importance of this process. Variety of testing options available, among them A/B testing can do wonders for knowing your click-through rates and so making them better.</p>
<h2>CREATE A MICRO LANDING PAGE</h2>
<p>You have not more than five seconds to convince people landing on your website to stick around and spend their valuable time on your site. For the respective purpose, the micro landing page is a full-page popup that comes in response to the user behavior. Creating a well-designed micro landing page and adding to the home page can increase conversion rates more than your thinking.</p>
<h2>USE EXPLAINER VIDEOS</h2>
<p>Explainer videos- <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/longer-is-better/">we all know are a perfect thing for attracting visitors to your site</a> and explaining them about the benefits and features of your product on the website. As the average user spends about 10-20 seconds on a website if there is no convincing reason to stay longer. But, adding things to their interests like explainer videos make them stay longer on your site. Moreover, it has emerged as one of the best tools for lead generation.</p>
<h2>END OF THE LINE</h2>
<p>Lastly, leads are imperative, not catching the lead means that website’s visitors are probably lost forever. In fact, lead generation site has noticeable differences compared to the rest.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Created website by putting all efforts, without taking much care about website’s metrics, is just like walking down a dark cave and assuming someone will torch a light for you.</p>
<p>Metrics are numbers that state accurate measurement and provide a base to suggest enhancements. Considering one measurement is not enough to measure the effectiveness of your website. Both operational and financial metrics are commonly used to track and assess the status of a specific process.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.spinweb.net/steps-to-audit-your-website-and-present-your-findings">Most of the professional web designers find difficult to choose right metric.</a> For convenience, I’ve compiled some of the well-known metrics helpful for your website:</p>

<h1>1.    Number of Website Visitors</h1>
<p>It is crucial to possess reliable source to track incoming traffic on your custom website. For the respective purpose, there’re three primary sources or three type of website visitors. The one who enters directly into your site by typing URL in browser address. The one who enters your site based on the search request. The last ones are the referral visitors. All three sources have a different level of conversion, and you should calculate traffic of each.</p>
<h1>2.    Bounce Rate</h1>
<p>In internet marketing, bounce rate refers to the measurement of people entering your website without going to any other webpage. Simply put, it is just like a single-page session that generates only a single request to the analytics server. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Low bounce rate means that visitors’ engagement is good on your site.</a> On the contrary, high bounce rate is an indicator of a bad situation.</p>
<h1>3.    Exit Pages</h1>
<p>Most of the visitors often get confused between “bounce” and “exit.”  Both are different metrics to measure. Unlike a “bounce,” when a site visitors enter to your site and hardly views one page, an “exit” is when a user enters and visits a number of pages and then abandon your site. If your website has a high exit rate, it has some problem. Knowing the exit rates and reasons one can improve site traffic and so conversion.</p>
<h1>4.    Crawl Errors</h1>
<p>Besides the metrics mentioned above, Google Search Console displays you crawl errors. It is pointless to say that, any crawl error on the website should be addressed soon, having crawl errors on site is as just your website does not work as they are supposed to and doesn’t bring you any conversion. It is imperative to check crawl errors report once a week and deal with what you find. High crawl errors mean that your site is either down or misconfigured. Low crawl errors is a temporary condition and also indicate your improper site configuration.</p>
<h1>5.    Final Conversions</h1>
<p>To know how well your strategy is working you need to know about final conversions. It is a metric and very simple to achieve. It is an achievement of the end goal you set in front of your business. Final conversion is the only metric that allows you if you should change anything on your website.</p>
<p>Though there are numerous other subtle metrics, but metrics mentioned above, are enough to make or destroy your professional website.</p>
