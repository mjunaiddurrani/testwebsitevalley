<h1>HIGHLIGHT YOUR CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTONS ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h1>
<p>Placing a call to action on your website is not tough, but putting them in the right place is essential. Build your CTA wisely to get more eyeballs of visitors and induce them to click. Offer your visitors things that they can&#8217;t refuse.</p>
<p>The call to action, better known as the “CTA,” is an appeal to visitors, inviting their response on a webpage, acting as an indication that guides the user through the next steps. If your call to action is not clear enough then the user may not know the following steps to take to purchase a product or sign up for a newsletter. In many cases, visitors leave the website without completing their task.</p>
<h2>USE TWITTER FOR LEAD GENERATION ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h2>
<p>The platform works almost for every business. The task is just to discover the right people and engaging them, which can be as simple as following them or taking part in a conversation. For the respective purpose, you can find people using Twitter search with relevant hashtags or keywords, or use LinkedIn to find specialists. You can also take help with some tools like CrowdFire or Followerwonk. The entire process requires a significant amount of time, but if done wisely, can produce prominent consequences. Of course, you have to link your twitter account with your website.</p>
<h2>TEST, TEST, TEST</h2>
<p>One cannot overlook the importance of this process. Variety of testing options available, among them A/B testing can do wonders for knowing your click-through rates and so making them better.</p>
<h2>CREATE A MICRO LANDING PAGE</h2>
<p>You have not more than five seconds to convince people landing on your website to stick around and spend their valuable time on your site. For the respective purpose, the micro landing page is a full-page popup that comes in response to the user behavior. Creating a well-designed micro landing page and adding to the home page can increase conversion rates more than your thinking.</p>
<h2>USE EXPLAINER VIDEOS</h2>
<p>Explainer videos- <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/longer-is-better/">we all know are a perfect thing for attracting visitors to your site</a> and explaining them about the benefits and features of your product on the website. As the average user spends about 10-20 seconds on a website if there is no convincing reason to stay longer. But, adding things to their interests like explainer videos make them stay longer on your site. Moreover, it has emerged as one of the best tools for lead generation.</p>
<h2>END OF THE LINE</h2>
<p>Lastly, leads are imperative, not catching the lead means that website’s visitors are probably lost forever. In fact, lead generation site has noticeable differences compared to the rest.
