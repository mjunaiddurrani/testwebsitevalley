				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All businesses today strive to increase the profit margin in order to smoothly manage and run their operations, expand services and offer a comparative advantage to the customers. However, this is easier said than done, especially in today’s modern and fast paced world where competition is tough.</p>
<p>Successfully aligning both the sales and marketing teams within a company is a practice which is as old as the entire corporate structure itself. For numerous companies, the marketing department’s job is to generate successful leads and the sale’s team’s job to turn them into loyal customers.</p>
<p>According to theory, it is important that both the marketing alongside the sales teams, work in tandem, to align shared goals as well as roles to ensure ROI becomes the responsibility or the organization, rather than that of individual teams.</p>
<p>Unluckily, building a solid team around marketing and sales alignment is usually easier said than done. Nevertheless, here are 5 brilliant ideas using which you can effectively implement an amazing strategy and make sure everyone keeps and works towards common goals and targets.</p>

<h1>Determine the Company’s Marketing Goals</h1>
<p>Even though this might sound a little cliché, but it is advised that you “Plan your work, and work your plan.” Developing a strategic plan is going to help your organization go a long way towards getting off to a very good start. When you are determining the marketing goals, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What new products and/or services will I be launching this year?</li>
<li>What is the overall revenue goal for this year?</li>
<li>What key metrics are extremely important when it comes to measuring my sales and marketing success?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Reduce Your Expenses</h1>
<p>One of the tried and tested ways using which you can bring up your sales is by reducing your expenses. For examples, you may want to consider having shared offices instead of having your own expansive and expensive space. Keep a track of your account books and identify where your money is going. After analyzing this, look for various different ways to reduce all the expenses incurred without actually compromising the business.</p>
<h1>Improve Your Customer Relationship</h1>
<p>You should also be active when it comes to improving your relationship with your clients. Focus on initiating loyalty. When consumers are loyal, you can trust that they will support your products, even when you increase prices, given that the quality remains top-notch. Research about your clients, think about customer segmentation, learn about what they need, and design approaches that will allow you to deliver a high level of consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is very easy to be overwhelmed when it comes to considering all the various different marketing choices and paths accessible to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">grow your business</a>. Nonetheless, with all signs pointing towards constant economic growth worldwide in the year 2018, there is still time to create a plan to increase revenue this year.</p>

<h1><strong>Catches the attention of People </strong></h1>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No need to mention that if you are running any business, you have to face new challenges to your business and customers. The common problems could be: lacking website traffic, lacking users’ interests, sales funnel deficit, and deprived lead conversion. It is sad to deal with such issues after spending much time, money and considerations to the business.</p>
<p>The good news is that the use of several marketing tactics can help you solve these problems across the board. With its flexibility helps you <a href="https://www.intechnic.com/blog/how-to-set-smart-business-goals-for-a-business-website/">make improvements and reach the goals that you have set earlier for your business</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dig more in-depth at the common business problems and how marketing can play a significant role in problem-solving.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/12/5-unsung-myths-marketing/">5 UNSUNG MYTHS ABOUT MARKETING</a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Content Marketing Campaign</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fresh, new, genuine content is like a fuel for your business. It can work to resolve many of the issues that your business is facing and presents you with a chance to position your business in the center of your target audience. If the content is compelling, interesting and on the recent topics, it can earn more attention. The user-centric is the only things which you cannot take as an optional. Write a genuine and fresh blog or web content relevant to your business. Make your content highly-relevant to your potential readers’ preferences. Understand their opinions and think about their likes and dislikes before writing any content. The headlines and titles get more attention and require more consideration.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Properly Optimized Web Content</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After preparing the content, get all your attention towards optimization. Proper optimization is a need. Incorporate relevant keywords into the content. Here, you cannot go recklessly. You have to be very wise and responsible about what keywords should be added on a content. For this, research thoroughly your audience about what word(s) they will use to search you on the search engine. Incorporate them into your content. However, do not use more than three or four keywords in one webpage. Exceed can be harmful, and even Google can penalize you for misusing keywords. So, be very careful.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Short and Long Tail Keywords</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This point is the extension of the second one, but I am writing this separately to emphasizing more. Keywords are king for any content, and the importance of them cannot be neglected. There are two types of keywords: Short-tail keywords and Long-tail Keywords. Short-tail keywords are search maxims with one word, whereas long-tail keywords are phrases with three-four words. Which type is more productive, is crucial to understand. According to SEO experts, the use of Long-tail keyword is more common, and so it should be incorporated into content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Social Media Network</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Having a social media presence helps you achieving more business recognition and customers</a>. In fact, social media is like a breeding ground which should be used wisely. Business owners, sometimes, lack users’ interests and find it difficult to get more conversion. Here in such situation, the platform helps you by providing you more recognition with the help of its 2.8 billion active users.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Email Marketing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With the technological advancement and social media presence, it seems like the use of email is decreasing. However, still, email marketing has its own importance when it comes to solving common problems your business face, such as sales funnel insufficiency and poor lead conversion. This type of marketing helps you a lot. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or ask sales or contributions, and is meant to build devotion, faith, or brand awareness. It is also crucial for building relationships with prospects, leads, and new customers as it gives you a chance to communicate directly to them and convince, in their inbox, at a time that is suitable for them.</p>
<p>Finally, I would say that one who knows even little about the marketing industry cannot refuse the significance of it. The industry is booming and getting more authority on each successive day. In fact, the future also seems more prosperous.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a single person living in this digital era can say ‘NO’ to the importance of Marketing. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">Marketing is compulsory for any business</a>. It is something through which you can make your product well-known in the eyes of the people. Not limited to this, the industry is developing on each successive day. Marketing can be referred as a breeding ground that has opened many doors of success not only for business but also for many folks. But, unfortunately, like many industries, this industry also become a prey of irrelevant myths. So, let’s check out some of the important myths of marketing:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/08/simple-introduction-custom-web-design/">A Simple Introduction To Custom Web Design</a></p>
<p>Myth #1: <strong>Customers Take Your Social Posts for granted</strong></p>
<p>It is not true. Customers read your social content and it also can convince and influence their purchasing decisions. The study reveals, “Nearly 70% of B2C companies and 40% of B2B companies have developed their customer base through social networking sites.” It doesn’t matter much what the social network is, any text, video, image, contest or coupon you publish will get countless eyeballs in this breeding ground with 2.2 billion users.</p>
<p>Myth #2: <strong>Marketing Should Define Future Products&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>It is believed that marketing group allegedly has a grip on what consumers want or prefer in a product or services, as characterized by a list of &#8220;market requirements.&#8221;  Though, in many cases, the marketing group doesn&#8217;t know much about customers’ requirements because of the communication gap. Most of the vendors only know about their current accounts think they want in the future.</p>
<p>Myth #3: <strong>Social media Heals Reputation Wounds</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/how-to-market-a-product">Marketing is all about promoting products to make sales</a>. Not taking care about website feedback is not helpful here. Receiving that outraged Rip-off Report is enough to put an end to your business reputation in search engine results. Each word you say matters a lot and cannot be taken back. In case of any problem, make sure that your social media pages possess active administrators authorized to alleviate any problem immediately, individually and systematically. Well, this myth is true at some extent.</p>
<p>Myth #4: <strong>No need to evaluate social success By Communal Interactions</strong></p>
<p>Sales opportunities or profits should measure the ultimate success you get through social interactions. Interactions may also help you with sales opportunities; but, if you don’t close any of those leads, the campaign will be nothing but a disappointment, regardless of how many interactions were bred. Marketing is about drive higher sales in which evaluation is essential to know which strategy is functional.</p>
<p>Myth #5: <strong>Marketing Costs Nothing</strong></p>
<p>The marketing industry is booming on each successive day. The scope and the benefits your business will get are countless. With such broader scope, the industry plays a vital role in creating employment and also fruitful socio-economic progress. Though the use of social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube are all free to use, hidden costs always exist when applying a social media marketing campaign for most customer boost.</p>
<p>For an active and fetching social media promotion, you need an expert who prioritizes and implements the plan, be able to message, and monitors the mediums for customer response. And it is apparent that he will charge heavy bucks for this job.</p>

<h1>Twitter</h1>
<p>The platform is full of interesting people, most of them are young. Today, the channel has more than 200 million active users. The 140 characters count of a tweet might be limited, but if it’s being used wisely, then it will payback you more than your thoughts. Twitter has its worth, importance to connect with people you want to interact with. And the good news is, once you get succeeded in gaining some popularity your account will take no time to go viral.</p>
<h1>YouTube</h1>
<p>YouTube is the most popular channel after Facebook. This video oriented site allows you create a Brand Account to give your business a YouTube presence of its own. With over 1 billion monthly visitors, it is the second largest search engine after Google. The YouTube market is competitive that invites engagement, sharing and theta users will enjoy.</p>
<p>Follow these three steps:</p>

<li>Add Managers to your YouTube Brand Account</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the best channel relevant to your business. Keep the niche of your business in front of your mind and pick the most productive one!</p>
<p><strong><em>So, here are some tips:</em></strong></p>
<p>Tip #1: Check out each channel, study them and find out the channel which will work more effectively for your business. Try to consider some of the factors with each channel: The product or service you are offering and the available resources at your disposal. Social media is free, but your time is precious enough to care.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Don’t use every channel or sign up on every platform for just because they’re new in the market or getting popular on the souk. Instead, find out the channel which is most relevant, effective to the business you’ve chosen to appeal your customers.</p>
<p>Tip #3: Before you’re going to decide which channel is more effective to work on, try to work out on a clear and implementable strategy. Many entrepreneurs or marketers lose their business focus while trying to be social. A play helps you actually to stay focused on a particular social channel.</p>
