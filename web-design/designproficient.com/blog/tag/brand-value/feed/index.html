				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever thought how a brand can create revenue? Do they solely have to exist to create results? Or maybe how brand connects to the ROI at all? Well, settle down because in this article you’ll find all of the answers that you’re looking for. Our brand architects and business analysts decide to educate the audience over brand knowledge. In this article, we’ll be educating you on how brand value connects with the ROI of an organization.</p>
<h1>So, what is a brand?</h1>
<p>The closest definition to what a <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/brand.html">brand </a>is by merely calling it a set of symbols bonded by a unique concept to represent a product and/or an organization. There are several people that often confuse brands with company or organizations. While an organization might act as the functional part, the brand acts as the representational part.</p>
<p>There might be a lot of work being pulled out at the back by a company or an organization; the brand value is what keeps the ball rolling. At this point, every layman reading gets confused. That too merely by the term ‘Brand Value’ so let’s just move on and illustrate what the term means.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/07/24/ui-essentials-perfect-web-ui-made/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UI essentials -What the perfect Web UI is made up of?</a></strong></p>
<h1>And what’s brand value?</h1>
<p>To anyone that isn’t aware of what brand value means, the economic value of the brand is usually called Brand Value. Each portion and asset of a brand is known for its brand value. For instance: McDonalds net worth and the worth of McDonald’s tagline, widely differ. The total value of the company and each of its brand assets are completely different.</p>
<p>So, what’s the science behind the connection of brand value and ROI? Well, it’s actually pretty simple. The more you market and sell your brand to your customers, the more they pay interest in it. The more they pay interest, the better they are to prefer you over any other competing brand. Finally, the more they prefer you over any other brand, the more your brand value increases and of course connects to the ROI as well since it’s your customer’s preference.</p>
<p>See? It’s that simple! Think you want to create a brand or revamp the brand that you already own? Well, that’s really no big deal when you have design enthusiasts and brand analysts from The Web Founders working side by side with you on your project.
