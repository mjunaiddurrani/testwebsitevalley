				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launching a website is the only half route towards online business, the other half is to bring potential customers to your website and stop the audience from driving away. Many small budget and simple sites can keep customers intact whereas many high budget websites are a total flop. The reason lies within the website design and development.</p>
<p>Here are six ways of driving customers away from a website and if your website is following any such pattern it’s time to change to earn more and more happy customers.</p>

<h1>URL is too complicated or misleading</h1>
<p>Complicated URLs never let the audience find your website while searching something of Google. URLs with numbers or tricky name, confusing spelling considered as least professional or tacky. Misleading URLs also play a role in confusing clients, and they don&#8217;t click BUY NOW button.</p>
<h1>Haphazard Landing Page</h1>
<p>Landing page with incorrect and unclear information is the biggest reason for leaving a website right ahead without checking out further information and company`s message. Landing page image and video are the two best chances to attract visitors and provoke them to visit service page or inventory of any website. When images are unorganized, information is not worthy, and the content is chaotic the visitors leave the site within 10 to 15 seconds.</p>
<h1>Pop-ups</h1>
<p>One or two pop-ups are fine, but too many pop-ups are exasperating and annoying. Useless and irrelevant pop-ups will drag the customer’s attention to something else, and many of them will shift to other <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">websites</a>.</p>
<h1>Grammar Errors in Content</h1>
<p>Grammar errors show the unprofessionalism and non-serious attitude of your company. Write simple and straightforward content with no grammar issues rather than finding quality in complex and long sentences.</p>
<h1>Complex Vocabulary</h1>
<p>No one will pay time to check for synonyms before placing an order on a website that’s why complex and rarely used vocabulary will only irritate people by not letting them understand your message. With poor message deliverance, the chances of getting good business are not possible.</p>
<h1>Auto-Music or Video</h1>
<p>Believe it or not auto music and video is a real pain. Firstly, out of nowhere something starts to play no matter you want to watch it or not. Secondly, it increases loading time, and in case of slow internet people can’t scroll or check other pages because of auto pay mode. Usually among multiple tabs, if something unnecessarily starts playing something people without giving a single look to website close that particular tab.</p>

<h1><strong>Catches the attention of People </strong></h1>

<p>We often overlooked the importance of design. It plays a vital role when it comes to convincing customers to buy your product.

It is in your hands how you make your dream turn into the reality. This will happen only if you work hard and you have to. For this, you need your image to be unique.

Your top quality work and consistency are what people require, and these are the things help you beat your competitors in the market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">are you hoping to increase sales on your website</a>? If yes, then you’re at the top of the ladder. Transform your website’s conversion rate with these six actions to escalate website sales and turn site visitors into permanent followers:</p>

<h1>1.    One Brand, One Product, One Target Market</h1>
<p>If your website is selling a wide range of products and services, then must test whether this strategy is effective for making more sales or not. It has been found that proposing not more than two products in one place always translates into higher sales. Offering one product is ideal for one target market. And It is better to focus on one product and answers all the queries of your customers related to that product. Instead of trying to gratify your site visitors by giving them a large variety of products with less information about each service or product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>2.    Keep Up your website with Customers</h1>
<p>Do you know what’s more to focus on your website? It is your customers. <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/successful-sales-pages/">The most effective sales copy emphases on its customers or reader</a>. Unfortunately, many businesspersons do not give importance to this simple golden rule. Be very careful about your sales copy. See if it is filled with references to &#8220;I,&#8221; &#8220;me&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221;? It is always better to use “you” and “your” in content.  By so doing, you are assuring customer’s importance and making content customer-centric and increase sales on site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>3.    Search engines love Fresh web-content</h1>
<p>Fresh, good web content helps to gain trustworthiness, reliance and ultimately sales from the people who visit your website. Start with brainstorming, see how you can make your web content more useful. Make sure your site looks professional, fresh and genuine. It must include your mission statement and possess relevant information about you and your services. The best web content should be user-centric. It should offer the information your visitors pursue and to present it in engaging and organized manner.</p>
<p>Here are some effective tips to help make your web content fresh and good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use conversational Language.</li>
<li>Use acquainted terminologies.</li>
<li>Offer all the relevant information.</li>
<li>Prefer real photos for your site. They work best.</li>
<li>Explain why your business is uniquely equipped to offer its products or services.</li>
<li>Keep your web content always up-to-date</li>
<li>Mention your contact information in multiple places</li>
<li>Clearly explain to your site visitors what you would like them to do next</li>
<li>Proofread your content. See, if it’s free from grammatical mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>4.    Get More Sales with Social Networking</h1>
<p>Having great content on website is good. But, it is not enough to produce high content and make the expectation that visitors find it – you have to control a whole situation rather than just responding to it after any mishap has happened. You have to get social to boost website traffic. Use different social media channels to promote your content. With 1.4 billion users, Facebook is ideal for interacting with customers. Twitter has more than 300 million, is renowned as a momentous brand awareness driving force. Pinterest is a giant in attracting predominantly female audiences. Instagram is popular among the young audience.</p>
<p>No matter what social media channel you’re opting for, your web content must always be geared toward reaching those visitors who can become potential customers or true fan.</p>
<h1>5.    SEO can never get old.</h1>
<p>The practice is valuable and worth more than before. There are two types of SEO: on-page and off-page. The techniques like creating internal links to your content, making the most of image alt text, giving importance to Meta descriptions are still considered as the backbone of On-page SEO. They help boost your organic traffic. On the other hand, off page SEO techniques can be used to improve the position of a website in the SERPs. The techniques include: Contribute as Guest Author, Forum submissions, Blog Directory Submission, Article Submission, Influencer Outreach and the list is endless.</p>
<h1>6.    Keywords still matter</h1>
<p>If you want more traffic, more leads, and better sales, then you’ll have to learn the proper use of keyword optimization to get more business. In keywords, you have two choices: Short-tail keywords and long-tail keywords. Short tail keywords are search watchwords with only one or two words. Long-tail keywords are broader, have three or more words.  Long tail keywords are more targeted and have significant search volume. Before going to actual keyword research, take some quality time to ask a few questions to yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is my audience?</li>
<li>Type of content my readers want to read</li>
<li>What should I offer as a solution for my customers?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also take help with keyword tools and get hundreds of keyword suggestions for your site, personalized to your industry and place.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media with 3 billion social network users around the world can be used for a range of purposes. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">The platform gives you the perfect opportunity to reach your target audience, build your product and know your rivals in the market.</a></p>
<p>Social media branding is all about the experience audience have with your product virtually. When it’s done correctly, it can and will help you connect to your target market in an ideal way.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we have to bring some little changes in our social media profiles. However, these type of changes come with quite a bit of stress and can be an overwhelming experience. In fact, it can put your online reputation in danger.</p>
<p>To be very honest, rebranding is not an easy task, if not done correctly can end up with a disaster. Proper planning, preparation, and thorough research are the things you must have to do before changing or launching your new Brand web-based social media image</p>
<p>So, let’s begin the journey:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/23/5-awesome-practices-responsive-web-design-professional-web-design-company/">5 AWESOME PRACTICES OF RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN FOR PROFESSIONAL WEB DESIGN COMPANY</a></p>
<h1>Firstly, Why Change the Image of Brand Web-Based Social Media?</h1>
<p>Before going through the process, we should see why we need to change to bring a change:</p>
<ul>
<li>When changing core values of your business</li>
<li>When you observe visuals are not interactive</li>
<li>When you have to reach a new audience</li>
<li>When you’re entering a new market</li>
<li>When you’re changing your product offerings</li>
</ul>
<p>Then,</p>
<h2>1.    Process with Highly-Organized Manner</h2>
<p>For many people, just the mere thought of getting organized can be intimidating. Keeping yourself organized is one of your strengths, it&#8217;s a habit everyone should get into. And here, you cannot ignore the importance of organizing your efforts.</p>
<p>When it comes to rebranding your business in social media, it&#8217;s crucial to realize that you only get one chance at a first impact, and hurrying the process can end up with a serious blunder. Well, thorough-research is your knight in shining armor. So, research everything from the social media platforms to the new expected audience and everything.</p>
<h2>2.    Let Your Audience Know About Your Plans</h2>
<p>Your followers, lovers, and customers should know about each and everything you’re going to do about your business. Not just to avoid panic, also connecting your social media community with your brand, it is crucial. By doing this, you’ll get their recognition, trust and probably their sweet help.</p>
<h2>3.    Research Each Social Media Platforms</h2>
<p>Whether it’s branding or rebranding social media profiles, the thorough research of each platform is a way to shoot. Once you have all your work organized, inform the audience about your plans, it’s time to find out the limitations behind each social media platform that might limit your capacity to change your Brand web-based social media profile. For instance:</p>
<p>Facebook – With 1.86 billion monthly active users, Facebook, is a great medium to market your brand, however, when it comes to rebranding page, this tool is overly defensive. Like, if you have more than 200 likes, you cannot switch your business page name. However, you have to make an entirely new page and in the result losing old followers.</p>
<p>LinkedIn – The rebranding is more complicated and more stringent here. Group profiles can change not more than five times, whereas for changing Company Pages you have to contact the LinkedIn Help Center &#8212; which is the daunting task.</p>
<p>Twitter – Comparatively, it gives you a quick and straightforward solution to change username and profile information.</p>
<h2>4.    Make No Compromise with Professionalism and Consistency</h2>
<p>It is crucial for you to update all your social media profiles on the same day, before your declaration. It will help you to deliver a professional image of your company to the people. To reduce the possibility of misunderstanding, make sure that your messages are consistent across all platforms.</p>
<h2>5.    Remember: It is more than just Changes names</h2>
<p>Of course,<a href="https://moz.com/blog/how-to-rebrand-your-social-media-accounts"> a rebranding is more than just switching names on social media networks</a>. You have to make sure your social media messages are well-aligned with your content, and PR. You also have to answer back to the people reaching out to you.</p>
<p>The goals should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make our followers pleased with the rebrand.</li>
<li>Answer all questions or queries, promptly, about the brand.</li>
<li>Have full coverage for launch.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, these are the things you have to make sure when changing your social media brand image. I hope, all these mentioned content might help you.</p>

Try to target relevant keywords with searcher’s intent in mind. And if you offer any services, create content around these keywords.</p>
<h1>Give a New Life to Your Old Content and Update It</h1>
<p>This tactic is becoming more popular than ever.</p>
<p>No point in posting more and more articles or blogs on the website if no one will ever read them. Instead, you should discover the web pages that are already giving you traffic, and it is better to update those pages for traffic growth. In fact, Google considers websites with the updated content and will rank them higher in a search engine. Many sites are using this tactic, and you should have to follow them.</p>
<h1>Prefer Some Paid Social Media Promotion</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/importance-social-media-business/">Each social media platform works significantly in advertising and cheaper than many other means of advertising</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter cover almost every audience, allow you to know about competitors and stand out among them. Pinterest is perfect for visual-related businesses, designs, etc. LinkedIn is the best option to target business professionals and getting a high ROI. Choose the best platform according to your niche.</p>
<h1>BLOGGING – Perfect Public Relations Tool</h1>
<p>Blogging drives high traffic. According to the case study blogging can result in 300% traffic boost in just 56 days. And this isn’t rare; another company also ran a similar experiment with even better results.</p>
<p>When you write a blog determine the main keywords that bring visitors to the website. Publish a quality blog post on a consistent basis. Ask questions that are related to your topic and also allow their responses and views. Establish a strong network with other blogs. Share your blog post on different social media platforms.</p>
<h1>Use Email Marketing, It Still Matters</h1>
<p>Email marketing is another usual way to drive traffic to the website. A newsletter is a fantastic tool for driving traffic. Make sure that you have a newsletter opt-in on your site. I would suggest you to use Drip. It’s free and fun to use.</p>
<h1>Make Sure Your Site Is Fast and Responsive</h1>
<p>It is very important for your website to be responsive on both devices: desktop and mobile. Along with responsiveness, the website should be fast as if it fails to load within three seconds then your bounce rate will sky high.</p>
<h1>Keep an Eye on Analytics Data</h1>
<p>Do not take your site analytics for granted, study analytics of your site and use extracted information in improving your content strategies. For the respective purpose, Google analytics is a reliable tool use to optimize website performance and conversions.</p>
<p>Consider mentioned ways to groom your website traffic. Hopefully, they’ll take your website traffic to the sky.</p>

Responsive design has three principles to be executed to work properly: Fluid grids, Media queries, and flexible images. To be responsive actually means to be adaptable.</p>
<ol start="2">

<h2><strong>Optimizing Images</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Another way to make your site SEO friendly is to optimize images with texts.</a> Just name your images descriptively, optimize your alt attributes, choose image dimensions, optimize thumbnails, use image sitemaps and test your images.</p>
<p>In fact, there’re many compression tools available that make the art of image optimization possible. ImageRecycle, OptimiZilla, Tinypng, giftofspeed, and kraken are some of the examples to compress multiple images or files in one go.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>Videos and Infographics</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Info graphics are  a visual representation of data beneficial to the website. Because more than 85% of information transmitted to brain is visual.</p>
<p>The act of embedding videos to the website is best way to get your message across. By putting interactive and interesting videos you can get heavy traffic on your site. As 44% of Google search results feature video.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So your boss asks you to audit your Google Analytics Reports, but when you dive headfirst into your accounts, you notice your seemingly robust traffic is… spam. A lot of it. This will likely happen to you at some point in your career, and it will be intensely frustrating. Trying to keep up with ever-evolving spammers is like playing Whack-a-Mole in the dark with one of those little rubber mallets you see in a doctor’s office, and that’s just as exhausting and confusing as it sounds. Fortunately, there’s a quick and pretty simple way to get your spam referrals under control with Google Analytics filters. It won’t solve all your spam problems forever, but it’ll put you on great footing early in 2017. And you deserve that.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/29/5-ux-principle-guide-product-design-product-design-agency/">5 UX PRINCIPLE TO GUIDE YOUR PRODUCT DESIGN FOR PRODUCT DESignageNCY</a></p>
<h1><strong>Create New Views</strong></h1>
<p>The very first thing you should do before you tinker with your account is set up three <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Google Analytics views.</a> The first should be a completely untouched, unfiltered accounting of your website traffic. The second should be a test view, where you’re going to screw around with filters and potentially break everything. The third should be your carefully vetted filtered view, which you’ll use for reporting purposes.</p>
<h2><strong>Google Analytics Filters</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://conversionxl.com/blog/google-analytics-setup-101/">Start by navigating into the Admin panel in your Google Analytics account.</a> After that, select “View Settings,” click the dropdown for “Create New View,” and get all three set up. From there, you can go into “Admin” and “Filters” to create new filters. Easy!</p>
<h2><strong>Set Up Comprehensive Filters</strong></h2>
<p>There are a variety of filters you could use, but for our money it’s tough to beat this guide from Analytics Edge. We’ve used this on our own site and for several clients, and we’ve found it removes 99% of the spam referrals we were seeing upon application. That includes all the most famous players, like semalt and heyclickhere.net.</p>
<h2><strong>Monitor Vigilantly</strong></h2>
<p>Once you have your views and filters set up, you’ll need to watch the test view carefully for a few days to ensure you’re getting the traffic you should be. You can also see any clever spam referrals that are sneaking through. If all is working as it should, apply that exact set of filters to your Filtered view. You can also simply clone the Test view (if you haven’t added any other odd filters) and reap the benefits.</p>
<p>One thing to note: These filters do not apply retroactively, so you’re still going to have to report on historical data with that annoying spam present. One of the easiest ways to do this is to consult your list of referrals, in particular, and look for anything from the Analytics Edge list of common spam sources. You can then then go to Customization and create a filtered report (filtering by Source) that removes those common spam referrals. It’s a little tedious to set these reports up, but it’s worthwhile.</p>
<p>Because spammers are constantly changing their tactics, this is never going to be a set-and-forget solution. Be sure to check resources like Analytics Edge on a regular basis to see what’s changed. If you do spot a new source of spam traffic, add it to your filters. This is the best way to ensure your reporting is based on clean, accurate data. Shockingly, your marketing efforts will benefit from that over the long haul.</p>
