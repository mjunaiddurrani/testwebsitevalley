				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard the saying, Content is fire; web design is its fuel? If so, you must know the importance of content is as same as the design of a site is. A content that is not unique, fresh, genuine, as per your customers’ preferences cannot give any benefit to you. Holding the gigantic significance, unique content is something you cannot overlook its importance in catching numerous eyeballs from people coming from different rivalries. Unique content is original and not duplicated anywhere else.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h1>Unique Content Can Educate People about Your Professional Website</h1>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Content is a resource of information which can be used to educate search engines about what your business caters to and how unique you are. It is important to bear in mind your website is depicted to search engines and must have to communicate your website’s purpose accurately. Try to optimize your website and permit search engine to know when to show your site in the results for appropriate search queries.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Unique Content Can Help You Raise in Search Engine</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keywords are considered to be essential for ranking. Keywords refer that you are looking for online prominence and that best define your products and services. Content should always reflect your keyword strategy. Content is a great place to highlight the relevant keywords in a natural, harmonious way and to support search engines make the connection between the keywords and your website that you have incorporated in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Unique Content Can Help You with Social Validation</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The importance of customers in business progress is undeniable. Earning their trust is essential to get that mark you always dream of. In chasing this dream, you have to give them the thing they want more from you: Social validation. I have seen numerous web pages and blog posts ranking well due to the social validation. This can be attained by trial and error method and lots of consideration. For business ranging from small to medium-sized business, the only way you can get social validation is by the quality and unique content writing.</p>
<p><strong>So, How To Write A Unique And Appealing Content?</strong></p>
<p>Here are few guidelines to incorporate in your writing style:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never steal a word from other resource. Stay away from plagiarism by citing research and using your own words to explain the topic.</li>
<li>Do not stick on one resource. Better to use multiple sources when researching.</li>
<li>Give your text a unique structure.</li>
<li>Incorporate your individual style.</li>
<li>Keep reliance on your rational thinking. Explain things how you comprehend them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>LAST THOUGHT</u></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">When your content is high in quality</a>, it delivers value. When your content provides people with what they are on the lookout for, they lean towards to engage with your content through numerous means. And this is how your content will earn it&#8217;s acknowledged and helps your website raise in search engine results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of text content is usually to communicate with the readers and connect them with information that may help them by any means. However the purpose of SEO content is slightly different from the usual. The kind of content required for search engine optimization has to qualify certain algorithms that Google announces in order to escalate a website’s ranking on the internet. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">SEO content is described better as the content which is approved by search engines</a> and has a higher probability of relevance, visibility to right kind of audience and is even more interest gauging.</p>
<p>Writing content is very easy for those who have a passion for writing or are just good with spinning the words. However, writing content for search engine optimization asks for a little more. There are certain things that a writer should keep in his mind while writing content for SEO purpose.</p>

<p>Let us discuss a few below!</p>
<p><strong>Keep your page load low</strong> – According to famous digital marketer and SEO expert, Neil Patel says that 40% of the people withdraw themselves from surfing on a page that takes more than 3 seconds to load. Make sure you craft the pages keeping these stats in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Make powerful and meaningful headlines</strong> – Headlines play an important role for SEO content. First of all your content must include headlines and these headlines should be in correct length and include relevant keywords in them.</p>
<p><strong>Make use of correct CTAs (Call to action)</strong> – <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/scannable-content/">SEO content must have a few lines that can drive the reader for an action</a>. You can do this by using words like “click, share or comment” at the end of your SEO blog or article.</p>
<p><strong>Address the reader</strong> – The sign of a good content is where the addressee is defined. The reader should be addressed directly throughout the content. This makes your content more engaging and optimizes its readability.</p>
<p><strong>Use of keywords</strong> – A well written content is the one which is backed by intelligent keyword research. A writer should know how to incorporate the picked keywords in their articles and follow the ratio in the content accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid using jargons</strong> – Jargons should not be used in great volume in a content. Try to go easy with words that can conveniently be understood by the readers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.webvanta.com/post/2014-08-04/10-tips-for-creating-websites-that-are-easy-to-maintain">Writing for a custom website is not a piece of cake</a>. If not done wisely, can ruin the complete persona of your website. No matter what and how your web design is making a striking impression by its appearance, the content writing is also worthy of remark. The content of your site should be readable, graspable and appealing to the readers. In this way, the conversational style works best. You have to destroy jargon, avid obscure acronyms, use active voice more, and set goals for your web content.</p>
<p>For your convenience, I’ve gathered some of the useful writing prescriptions for the web. So, scroll through:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/02/4-ways-developing-effective-brand-identity/">4 WAYS TO DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE BRAND IDENTITY</a></p>
<h1>1.    Start with setting the Tone</h1>
<p>There are two important things to give importance before explaining the appropriate tone of your site. Your target audience and what your website is aiming to achieve. So, start with asking &#8212; who’s your target audience? How old are they? Where they live? What values do they give importance to? Most importantly, what their preferences are? And about website, is it an e-commerce website? Is it about educational purpose?</p>
<p>Your audience and your professional website,<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web"> both are important when it comes to writing content on your site</a>. By knowing your audience precisely you may craft writing relevant to their interest in your site.</p>
<h1>2. Be professional AND human</h1>
<p>Try to avoid adding too much marketing jargon. By doing this, you are isolating yourself, as people don’t feel like they’re being sold. In this age, we are surrounded by a number of ads. Find out the appropriate way to present your business clearly, without losing your human face. Even, I also believe that people respond more quickly and better when they can see the professional man in front of him.</p>
<h1>3. Be concise</h1>
<p>You will be wonder to know that average attention span of a web user is not more than 7 seconds. By this, it meant that you have to make these limited time appealing enough to attract more eyeballs. It’s better to be creative and smart. But, everything is good if it remains in accord. Give your people the information they want before they lose their interest in your writing and head back to Google.</p>
<p>Being a writer, your aim should be and must be to avoid unnecessary or needless words in a sentence. Unnecessary words result in idleness.  You can achieve efficiency in your writing by using precise and concise words or phrases that denote some strong meaning and have power. The easy way to do so is to write everything you want and then eliminate those words from a context or sentence which you think are not contributing much. In other words, if a word can be eliminated from a text without affecting its meaning, it should be removed.</p>
<h1>4.    Use short words Use short sentences Use short paragraphs</h1>
<p>Do not go for long and complicated sentences. Shorter sentences are better than the longer ones. In fact, the short sentence is better because in this way there&#8217;s less risk of grammatical mistakes.</p>
<h1>5.    Focus on headlines</h1>
<p>Headling or titles that contain amazing adjectives are more likely to attract a lot more likes. On the other hand, if you see content with less-compelling headlines not get more clicks or retweets. So, try to incorporate highly-persuasive adjectives into your headlines.</p>
<p>So, these are some of the most important writing prescription for the web. I hope you like my blog!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">Digital marketing</a> is the backbone of business in today`s world. Most of the consumers first visit the website of the brand and after that, they decide whether to go for specific brand/product/ service or not.</p>
<p>Last few years have dramatically changed the way of marketing and selling the products. Reviews, optimizations, activities, and many other things matter a lot when it comes to modern digital marketing strategies.</p>
<p>In this blog, I am mentioning 2018 plan about your Digital Marketing Strategy for efficient and productive results.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Right Tone on Your Website</h1>
<p>Previously websites were developed and designed with a different tone. Now the selection of colors, words, call to actions, images and sizes of design objects are placed in a way that they create a required tone suitable for the targeted audience. The tone of the website not only attract customers but also allow them to explore the website thoroughly.</p>
<h2>Try Some Modern Means</h2>
<p>Apparently, if you will follow old or outdated means of designing, and develop your <a href="https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/top-10-free-websites-promote-mobile-app/">website and application</a>, eventually your business will suffer. Incorporation of modern technology gives an energetic and appealing look to your brand. For example, nowadays clothing brands design their applications and website by incorporating VR and AR technologies. It helps customers to view how they will look while wearing any product even before the actual product is delivered to them.</p>
<h2>SEO targeted content</h2>
<p>Having a website that equilibriums user experience with <a href="https://www.atomicdc.com/blog/google-instant-a-game-changer-for-seo-and-sem/">SEO is a game changer</a> for any marketing plan. In simple words, the appropriate use of keywords at right places, high-level interactivity, and simple yet genuine content can give your brand a new value. Adding tons of text, bogus information and inappropriate material distract the audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Customer Information</h2>
<p>It is not a big deal to get the required information about the potential customers. Geographical location, age group, preferences, psychology, etc. help a lot to design a perfect digital marketing plan for any brand. Customer`s information can be obtained through IP address tracking, surveys, advertisement engagement, social media, applications, etc. So it’s better to do some research rather than pitching a flop or less effective marketing plan to your clients.</p>
<h2>Show Your Presence</h2>
<p>For instance, your advertisement is live, your website and social media pages are receiving a good response. But you as a brand is not paying attention to reviews, queries, and issues of your audience, in that case, it’s almost impossible to mark brand`s value in the customer&#8217;s mind. People will trust the brand more if they actively show their presence and communicate with the audience.</p>
