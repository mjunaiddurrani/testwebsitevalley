				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launching a website is the only half route towards online business, the other half is to bring potential customers to your website and stop the audience from driving away. Many small budget and simple sites can keep customers intact whereas many high budget websites are a total flop. The reason lies within the website design and development.</p>
<p>Here are six ways of driving customers away from a website and if your website is following any such pattern it’s time to change to earn more and more happy customers.</p>

<h1>URL is too complicated or misleading</h1>
<p>Complicated URLs never let the audience find your website while searching something of Google. URLs with numbers or tricky name, confusing spelling considered as least professional or tacky. Misleading URLs also play a role in confusing clients, and they don&#8217;t click BUY NOW button.</p>
<h1>Haphazard Landing Page</h1>
<p>Landing page with incorrect and unclear information is the biggest reason for leaving a website right ahead without checking out further information and company`s message. Landing page image and video are the two best chances to attract visitors and provoke them to visit service page or inventory of any website. When images are unorganized, information is not worthy, and the content is chaotic the visitors leave the site within 10 to 15 seconds.</p>
<h1>Pop-ups</h1>
<p>One or two pop-ups are fine, but too many pop-ups are exasperating and annoying. Useless and irrelevant pop-ups will drag the customer’s attention to something else, and many of them will shift to other <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">websites</a>.</p>
<h1>Grammar Errors in Content</h1>
<p>Grammar errors show the unprofessionalism and non-serious attitude of your company. Write simple and straightforward content with no grammar issues rather than finding quality in complex and long sentences.</p>
<h1>Complex Vocabulary</h1>
<p>No one will pay time to check for synonyms before placing an order on a website that’s why complex and rarely used vocabulary will only irritate people by not letting them understand your message. With poor message deliverance, the chances of getting good business are not possible.</p>
<h1>Auto-Music or Video</h1>
<p>Believe it or not auto music and video is a real pain. Firstly, out of nowhere something starts to play no matter you want to watch it or not. Secondly, it increases loading time, and in case of slow internet people can’t scroll or check other pages because of auto pay mode. Usually among multiple tabs, if something unnecessarily starts playing something people without giving a single look to website close that particular tab.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Optimize high impact custom websites is crucial to keep people in the know and ready to do their part. Web developers will need to optimize high impact web pages. For convenience, I’ve collected several important tips:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/16/effective-logo-design-tips-professional-business-logo/">Effective Logo Design Tips for Professional Business Logo</a></p>
<h1>1st tip# Create great content</h1>
<p>If you want to rank high in the search engine, then a high content can help you the most. Websites with a fresh, genuine and relevant content are more likely to get a chance to rank. Avoid grammatical mistakes and spelling lower. The question, how long the content should be? must be popping in your mind. Well, there’s no exact answer to it, but it should be at least not smaller than 500 words. In fact, for many, it is good minimum length for a typical blog post.</p>
<p>If we go with research, then it has shown that posts longer than 1000 words tend to rank better. Search engine likes authoritative posts with more than 2000 words. It means, if you want to improve your ranking chances in the future with in-depth articles or blogs, you have to focus on both quality and quantity. The content must be excellent in quality, should be more than 2000 words. So, try to make your writings fun to read, avoid being too much promotional, don’t be boring and assure your content should not look like a legal document. As an alternative, opt for friendly, amusing content.</p>
<h2>2nd tip# Build backlinks to your website</h2>
<p>You need to link your web content with other internal custom web pages. This would be beneficial to your audience, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">will help improve your website’s SEO</a>, make it comfortable for readers to find something useful from your site.</p>
<h2>3rd tip# Optimized URLs</h2>
<p>It will benefit you more if you put keywords in URLs.  Make sure, the keywords you’re putting should be relevant and not inadequate.</p>
<h2>4th tip# Page titles</h2>
<p>Your website’s page must possess compelling and relevant title with some keywords. The title should be descriptive enough to grasp by the readers about the content. For instance, if your blog is about “Effective Logo Designing,” then a great title should be “Effective Logo Designing in ten easy tips” or “<a href="https://www.designhill.com/design-blog/simple-logo-design-recognition/">How to create an effective logo for your business</a>.” However, make sure that your page title should not longer than 70 characters. Although Google will index lengthier page titles, they will be shortened in the search results.</p>
<h2>5th tip# Header tags</h2>
<p>It would be perfect to incorporate the keyword phrase in a header tag, but make sure you’re not spoiling it. The ideal way to include a keyword phrase in a header tag is to use the first heading on the web page as the search engine will pay more attention to H1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6th tip# Make your Professional Web page load faster</h2>
<p>For search engine how much time your website takes in load matters a lot. In fact, it is ranking factor for Google. New case study sheds light that when search engine added website speed into the Algorithm, sites that took more than five minutes to load had to face a severe drop in traffic from search engine. That means fixing page load speed is necessary which can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check how much time your website takes to load.</li>
<li>Optimize your website or web page to improve the overall performance of it.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re using a shared hosting server, you can try switching to a different hosting provider to see if it makes a positive difference. Measure performance again after making changes.</li>
<li>See if your website has any unnecessary things, remove all of them quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow these tips and optimize your high impact web pages.</p>

If yes, then you’re at the top of the ladder. Transform your website’s conversion rate with these six actions to escalate website sales and turn site visitors into permanent followers:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/11/5-best-social-media-marketing-services-instantly-impact-sales/">5 Best Social Media Marketing Services That Instantly Impact Sales</a></p>
<h1>1.    One Brand, One Product, One Target Market</h1>
<p>If your website is selling a wide range of products and services, then must test whether this strategy is effective for making more sales or not. It has been found that proposing not more than two products in one place always translates into higher sales. Offering one product is ideal for one target market. And It is better to focus on one product and answers all the queries of your customers related to that product. Instead of trying to gratify your site visitors by giving them a large variety of products with less information about each service or product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>2.    Keep Up your website with Customers</h1>
<p>Do you know what’s more to focus on your website? It is your customers. <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/successful-sales-pages/">The most effective sales copy emphases on its customers or reader</a>. Unfortunately, many businesspersons do not give importance to this simple golden rule. Be very careful about your sales copy. See if it is filled with references to &#8220;I,&#8221; &#8220;me&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221;? It is always better to use “you” and “your” in content.  By so doing, you are assuring customer’s importance and making content customer-centric and increase sales on site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>3.    Search engines love Fresh web-content</h1>
<p>Fresh, good web content helps to gain trustworthiness, reliance and ultimately sales from the people who visit your website. Start with brainstorming, see how you can make your web content more useful. Make sure your site looks professional, fresh and genuine. It must include your mission statement and possess relevant information about you and your services. The best web content should be user-centric. It should offer the information your visitors pursue and to present it in engaging and organized manner.</p>
<p>Here are some effective tips to help make your web content fresh and good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use conversational Language.</li>
<li>Use acquainted terminologies.</li>
<li>Offer all the relevant information.</li>
<li>Prefer real photos for your site. They work best.</li>
<li>Explain why your business is uniquely equipped to offer its products or services.</li>
<li>Keep your web content always up-to-date</li>
<li>Mention your contact information in multiple places</li>
<li>Clearly explain to your site visitors what you would like them to do next</li>
<li>Proofread your content. See, if it’s free from grammatical mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>4.    Get More Sales with Social Networking</h1>
<p>Having great content on website is good. But, it is not enough to produce high content and make the expectation that visitors find it – you have to control a whole situation rather than just responding to it after any mishap has happened. You have to get social to boost website traffic. Use different social media channels to promote your content. With 1.4 billion users, Facebook is ideal for interacting with customers. Twitter has more than 300 million, is renowned as a momentous brand awareness driving force. Pinterest is a giant in attracting predominantly female audiences. Instagram is popular among the young audience.</p>
<p>No matter what social media channel you’re opting for, your web content must always be geared toward reaching those visitors who can become potential customers or true fan.</p>
<h1>5.    SEO can never get old.</h1>
<p>The practice is valuable and worth more than before. There are two types of SEO: on-page and off-page. The techniques like creating internal links to your content, making the most of image alt text, giving importance to Meta descriptions are still considered as the backbone of On-page SEO. They help boost your organic traffic. On the other hand, off page SEO techniques can be used to improve the position of a website in the SERPs. The techniques include: Contribute as Guest Author, Forum submissions, Blog Directory Submission, Article Submission, Influencer Outreach and the list is endless.</p>
<h1>6.    Keywords still matter</h1>
<p>If you want more traffic, more leads, and better sales, then you’ll have to learn the proper use of keyword optimization to get more business. In keywords, you have two choices: Short-tail keywords and long-tail keywords. Short tail keywords are search watchwords with only one or two words. Long-tail keywords are broader, have three or more words.  Long tail keywords are more targeted and have significant search volume. Before going to actual keyword research, take some quality time to ask a few questions to yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is my audience?</li>
<li>Type of content my readers want to read</li>
<li>What should I offer as a solution for my customers?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also take help with keyword tools and get hundreds of keyword suggestions for your site, personalized to your industry and place.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.webvanta.com/post/2014-08-04/10-tips-for-creating-websites-that-are-easy-to-maintain">Writing for a custom website is not a piece of cake</a>. If not done wisely, can ruin the complete persona of your website. No matter what and how your web design is making a striking impression by its appearance, the content writing is also worthy of remark. The content of your site should be readable, graspable and appealing to the readers. In this way, the conversational style works best. You have to destroy jargon, avid obscure acronyms, use active voice more, and set goals for your web content.</p>
<p>For your convenience, I’ve gathered some of the useful writing prescriptions for the web. So, scroll through:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/02/4-ways-developing-effective-brand-identity/">4 WAYS TO DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE BRAND IDENTITY</a></p>
<h1>1.    Start with setting the Tone</h1>
<p>There are two important things to give importance before explaining the appropriate tone of your site. Your target audience and what your website is aiming to achieve. So, start with asking &#8212; who’s your target audience? How old are they? Where they live? What values do they give importance to? Most importantly, what their preferences are? And about website, is it an e-commerce website? Is it about educational purpose?</p>
<p>Your audience and your professional website,<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web"> both are important when it comes to writing content on your site</a>. By knowing your audience precisely you may craft writing relevant to their interest in your site.</p>
<h1>2. Be professional AND human</h1>
<p>Try to avoid adding too much marketing jargon. By doing this, you are isolating yourself, as people don’t feel like they’re being sold. In this age, we are surrounded by a number of ads. Find out the appropriate way to present your business clearly, without losing your human face. Even, I also believe that people respond more quickly and better when they can see the professional man in front of him.</p>
<h1>3. Be concise</h1>
<p>You will be wonder to know that average attention span of a web user is not more than 7 seconds. By this, it meant that you have to make these limited time appealing enough to attract more eyeballs. It’s better to be creative and smart. But, everything is good if it remains in accord. Give your people the information they want before they lose their interest in your writing and head back to Google.</p>
<p>Being a writer, your aim should be and must be to avoid unnecessary or needless words in a sentence. Unnecessary words result in idleness.  You can achieve efficiency in your writing by using precise and concise words or phrases that denote some strong meaning and have power. The easy way to do so is to write everything you want and then eliminate those words from a context or sentence which you think are not contributing much. In other words, if a word can be eliminated from a text without affecting its meaning, it should be removed.</p>
<h1>4.    Use short words Use short sentences Use short paragraphs</h1>
<p>Do not go for long and complicated sentences. Shorter sentences are better than the longer ones. In fact, the short sentence is better because in this way there&#8217;s less risk of grammatical mistakes.</p>
<h1>5.    Focus on headlines</h1>
<p>Headling or titles that contain amazing adjectives are more likely to attract a lot more likes. On the other hand, if you see content with less-compelling headlines not get more clicks or retweets. So, try to incorporate highly-persuasive adjectives into your headlines.</p>
<p>So, these are some of the most important writing prescription for the web. I hope you like my blog!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people landing on your website, they do not spend more than five seconds to decide whether to move further or not. Therefore, investing in UX is considered as necessary to gain trust, brand recognition and guarantee user preservation.</p>
<p>For respective purpose you have to follow several technique, some of which I’ve mentioned bellow</p>

<h1>UNIFORM DESIGN</h1>
<p>Once you have decided the design of your application or website, stick on it until the end. Make sure the design you have picked must possess consistency and uniformity. The user should be not get confused in website, whether it is about typography, color or anything. The bold typography with compelling color get more eyeballs and the thing which make them more attracted is consistency. It is your task to be consistent with the aesthetics and construction throughout the development of the app.</p>
<h2>VISUAL HIERARCHY OF CONTENTS</h2>
<p>With uniformity and consistency, also maintain hierarchy or balance in visual contents. The design of the text and icons without including empty spaces inside should be your first option. Maintaining the visual hierarchy is important as it delivers users comfortable experience of readability.</p>
<h2>PERSONALIZE THE UX</h2>
<p>Personalization is when the behavior of past visits is recorded by an app, and stored for retargeting determinations. If a user has specific buying patterns, you can provide them with proposals and deals to assist them with their purchasing decisions. Personalization offers more unique and relevant user experience. The more aligned the experience is with a user’s requirements and inclinations, the <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/App-Design-and-Development">more likely they are to continue to use the application.</a></p>
<h2>OFFER ASSISTANCE</h2>
<p>Offer your users assistance within the app by providing different support options. Users will often search for help in the toolbar or tab bar of an app. Offer multiple ways for users to receive support, including self-serve FAQs and live support through click-to-call buttons.</p>
<h2> QUALITATIVE DATA</h2>
<p>So, you are working really hard on your design and want to examine the effectiveness of your efforts. For that traditional and free analytics are should not be your choice. I will tell you both qualitative and quantitative data are equally important in order to fully grasp your UX and pinpoint opportunities for optimization. Qualitative data allow you to visualize what is actually going on inside your app and how your user behaviors. This way you can improve user experience.</p>
<h2>TRANSPARENCY TO SHARING OPTIONS</h2>
<p>Today, many of are more comfortable of sharing personal <a href="https://www.hswsolutions.com/services/mobile-web-development/mobile-website-vs-apps/">information on devices such as mobile and within apps</a>. It increased concerns about how that data is kept, shared and used.</p>
<p>So, to establish more trustworthy relationship with your users, explain precisely what they’re sharing and with whom. No users want their private content shared on social networks without their awareness or consents, and if that occurs, you’ll not just lose trust, you’re probably also getting a negative review, which has additional downstream effects.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a fashion app or website, do not dare to assume that people on your app will robotically want to share their styling ideas or progress with their Facebook or LinkedIn community. Instead, make sure to offer a variety of sharing choices for your users that they can switch on and off at-will.</p>
<p>So, these are some of techniques you must use to make your users feel like they’re in a right place when they come to your website.</p>

<h1>HIGHLIGHT YOUR CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTONS ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h1>
<p>Placing a call to action on your website is not tough, but putting them in the right place is essential. Build your CTA wisely to get more eyeballs of visitors and induce them to click. Offer your visitors things that they can&#8217;t refuse.</p>
<p>The call to action, better known as the “CTA,” is an appeal to visitors, inviting their response on a webpage, acting as an indication that guides the user through the next steps. If your call to action is not clear enough then the user may not know the following steps to take to purchase a product or sign up for a newsletter. In many cases, visitors leave the website without completing their task.</p>
<h2>USE TWITTER FOR LEAD GENERATION ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h2>
<p>The platform works almost for every business. The task is just to discover the right people and engaging them, which can be as simple as following them or taking part in a conversation. For the respective purpose, you can find people using Twitter search with relevant hashtags or keywords, or use LinkedIn to find specialists. You can also take help with some tools like CrowdFire or Followerwonk. The entire process requires a significant amount of time, but if done wisely, can produce prominent consequences. Of course, you have to link your twitter account with your website.</p>
<h2>TEST, TEST, TEST</h2>
<p>One cannot overlook the importance of this process. Variety of testing options available, among them A/B testing can do wonders for knowing your click-through rates and so making them better.</p>
<h2>CREATE A MICRO LANDING PAGE</h2>
<p>You have not more than five seconds to convince people landing on your website to stick around and spend their valuable time on your site. For the respective purpose, the micro landing page is a full-page popup that comes in response to the user behavior. Creating a well-designed micro landing page and adding to the home page can increase conversion rates more than your thinking.</p>
<h2>USE EXPLAINER VIDEOS</h2>
<p>Explainer videos- <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/longer-is-better/">we all know are a perfect thing for attracting visitors to your site</a> and explaining them about the benefits and features of your product on the website. As the average user spends about 10-20 seconds on a website if there is no convincing reason to stay longer. But, adding things to their interests like explainer videos make them stay longer on your site. Moreover, it has emerged as one of the best tools for lead generation.</p>
<h2>END OF THE LINE</h2>
<p>Lastly, leads are imperative, not catching the lead means that website’s visitors are probably lost forever. In fact, lead generation site has noticeable differences compared to the rest. So, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">follow some good techniques, including that I’ve mentioned and enjoyed healthy leads on your website</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us spend more than two hours online every day using different devices with screens that require near exclusive attention where more than trillion websites and the same quantity of mobile apps are battling for our valuable time and attention. To make sure you achieve maximum attention of people in your website or app, The Web Founders has selected some crucial tactics or advices to make you stand out from the rest with your exceptional interface.</p>
<p>So, let’s drive&#8230;</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/24/change-brand-web-based-social-media-image-utilizing-design/">HOW TO CHANGE YOUR BRAND WEB-BASED SOCIAL MEDIA IMAGE UTILIZING DESIGN?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>1.    BE CAREFUL WITH NEW UI PATTERNS</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/design/10-quick-tips-for-uiux-design/">Do not make your audience to think too hard about the interface elements</a>. Most of the elements are already known to users. By this I meant, CTA should look like CTA, Links should look like links and so on.</p>
<p>There is no need to get too creative with common patterns or designs. It might sound exciting to do something out of the box or unique with them, but that does not mean usable. Usability and creativity need to be well-adjusted.</p>
<h1>2.    BE CAREFUL ABOUT SIMPLICITY</h1>
<p>It takes no longer than five seconds for users to judge your website, or whether they’re interested or not, so just be careful about what you want users to do on your site. Consider things that help you to make it easy to use. For the respective purpose, prefer consistent design, it is more straightforward or familiar for visitors because it reprocesses constituents, shades, and aesthetic to lessen the requirement for visitors to rethink.</p>
<h1>3.    BE DIRECT AND STAY HONEST</h1>
<p>By staying honest with yourself and visitors, you can convey your message with confidence. Honesty with a user works more than your thinking. So, for this purpose consider social proof instead of just talking about potentials. Nothing will upsurge your conversion as utterly as being honest with the customers.</p>
<h1>4.    COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CUSTOMERS</h1>
<p>Knowing who your users are, is crucial to make the interface most comfortable for them. For this, you have to select the audience relevant to your business. For example, if your website is about stylish chic outfits for women, choose women who want to wear such modern clothes. After targeting the audience, research on them to know their preferences and desires.</p>
<h1>5.    THINK HOW USERS WILL USE YOUR INTERFACE</h1>
<p>Before designing interface, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">you need to see how visitors will use your website or interface.</a> People landing on your site use it in two ways:</p>
<p>Directly: interacting with the elements of the product.</p>
<p>Indirectly: interacting with an element external to the product.</p>
<h2>Instances of direct interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Taking a card</li>
<li>Tapping a button</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping an item with a fingertip</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instances of indirect interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using key commands and shortcuts</li>
<li>Indicating and clicking with a mouse</li>
<li>Drawing on a Wacom tablet</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>6.    SET EXPECTATIONS</h1>
<p>Most of the interactions – directly or indirectly – have some consequences and sometimes, also anxiety. But, you can eliminate this anxiety of users by allowing your users know what will happen just after clicking that particular button before they do it. You can do this through thoughtful design. Highlight the CTA button with appropriate color that has strong meaning. Like we all know green is for a ‘go’ and red for ‘stop.’ You can also use widely understood symbols in a blend with the copy.</p>
<h1>7.    GIVE RESPONSE—FAST</h1>
<p>We are living in a world where environment gives us feedback or respond to our every action. Do you remember to know the stimulus and response theory? The theory implicates here &#8212; We speak, and others respond, or they speak, we respond.</p>
<p>When it comes to your website make sure it all happens quick. Any delay over 2-second mark as an interruption and more than that is enough to cause a bounce. So make your site fast and remove all unnecessary barriers for your users.</p>
<h1>8.    RECOGNITION TO RECALL</h1>
<p>This principle is psychological, suggests, if you have many choices, it is not that hard for you to recognize something already known. Recognition principle should be used wisely to make an experience more comfortable for users. The challenge with recognition is to give users familiar elements which they have been exposed to earlier, instead of expecting them to have a creative idea.</p>
<h1>END OF THE LINE</h1>
<p>So, these are some of tips we have gathered from different sources and experts. Hopefully, they will work for your website..</p>

<p>Social media branding is all about the experience audience have with your product virtually. When it’s done correctly, it can and will help you connect to your target market in an ideal way.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we have to bring some little changes in our social media profiles. However, these type of changes come with quite a bit of stress and can be an overwhelming experience. In fact, it can put your online reputation in danger.</p>
<p>To be very honest, rebranding is not an easy task, if not done correctly can end up with a disaster. Proper planning, preparation, and thorough research are the things you must have to do before changing or launching your new Brand web-based social media image</p>
<p>So, let’s begin the journey:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/23/5-awesome-practices-responsive-web-design-professional-web-design-company/">5 AWESOME PRACTICES OF RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN FOR PROFESSIONAL WEB DESIGN COMPANY</a></p>
<h1>Firstly, Why Change the Image of Brand Web-Based Social Media?</h1>
<p>Before going through the process, we should see why we need to change to bring a change:</p>
<ul>
<li>When changing core values of your business</li>
<li>When you observe visuals are not interactive</li>
<li>When you have to reach a new audience</li>
<li>When you’re entering a new market</li>
<li>When you’re changing your product offerings</li>
</ul>
<p>Then,</p>
<h2>1.    Process with Highly-Organized Manner</h2>
<p>For many people, just the mere thought of getting organized can be intimidating. Keeping yourself organized is one of your strengths, it&#8217;s a habit everyone should get into. And here, you cannot ignore the importance of organizing your efforts.</p>
<p>When it comes to rebranding your business in social media, it&#8217;s crucial to realize that you only get one chance at a first impact, and hurrying the process can end up with a serious blunder. Well, thorough-research is your knight in shining armor. So, research everything from the social media platforms to the new expected audience and everything.</p>
<h2>2.    Let Your Audience Know About Your Plans</h2>
<p>Your followers, lovers, and customers should know about each and everything you’re going to do about your business. Not just to avoid panic, also connecting your social media community with your brand, it is crucial. By doing this, you’ll get their recognition, trust and probably their sweet help.</p>
<h2>3.    Research Each Social Media Platforms</h2>
<p>Whether it’s branding or rebranding social media profiles, the thorough research of each platform is a way to shoot. Once you have all your work organized, inform the audience about your plans, it’s time to find out the limitations behind each social media platform that might limit your capacity to change your Brand web-based social media profile. For instance:</p>
<p>Facebook – With 1.86 billion monthly active users, Facebook, is a great medium to market your brand, however, when it comes to rebranding page, this tool is overly defensive. Like, if you have more than 200 likes, you cannot switch your business page name. However, you have to make an entirely new page and in the result losing old followers.</p>
<p>LinkedIn – The rebranding is more complicated and more stringent here. Group profiles can change not more than five times, whereas for changing Company Pages you have to contact the LinkedIn Help Center &#8212; which is the daunting task.</p>
<p>Twitter – Comparatively, it gives you a quick and straightforward solution to change username and profile information.</p>
<h2>4.    Make No Compromise with Professionalism and Consistency</h2>
<p>It is crucial for you to update all your social media profiles on the same day, before your declaration. It will help you to deliver a professional image of your company to the people. To reduce the possibility of misunderstanding, make sure that your messages are consistent across all platforms.</p>
<h2>5.    Remember: It is more than just Changes names</h2>
<p>Of course,<a href="https://moz.com/blog/how-to-rebrand-your-social-media-accounts"> a rebranding is more than just switching names on social media networks</a>. You have to make sure your social media messages are well-aligned with your content, and PR. You also have to answer back to the people reaching out to you.</p>
<p>The goals should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make our followers pleased with the rebrand.</li>
<li>Answer all questions or queries, promptly, about the brand.</li>
<li>Have full coverage for launch.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, these are the things you have to make sure when changing your social media brand image. I hope, all these mentioned content might help you.</p>

Make sure the letters should be stand out from the background. Also, create a visual rhythm of each element with the wise use of a grid.</p>
