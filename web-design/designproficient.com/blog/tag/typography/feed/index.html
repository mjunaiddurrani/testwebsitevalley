				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Typography is undoubtedly one of the most prestigious yet complex disciplines in graphic design. It doesn’t matter how skilled you are in this specific domain of graphic design, there’s something always to learn. The weird part about typography is that it isn’t constant from any angle. There are several different fonts, hundreds of different combination and thousands of different concepts that fall under the umbrella of typography.</p>
<p>Our team of creative thinkers love to share their ideas here at the The Web Founders blog to help young design talent in becoming better every passing day. Here are a few tips and tricks to keep your creative juices flowing.</p>
<h2><strong>Invest Time</strong></h2>
<p>Keep one thing in mind: good typography, takes time. Invest as much time as you can to create something incomparable. Search for a typeface that suits your idea, background, color, shapes in the picture and much more. Starting with basic fonts can be easier but continuing to work only with the basics isn’t the right route to the future. Keep your research strong and invest your time properly on your typography for excellent results.</p>

<h2><strong>Limit Your Typefaces</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, you need a combination of different fonts but you need to limit your typefaces to a maximum of 2 or 3. Anything more than 5 fonts per design is just going to take the essence away from the design. Use fewer designs with a bigger impact on the design to create results that actually matter for your business.</p>
<h2><strong>Trends Can Be Deceiving</strong></h2>
<p>Futureproofing a superior design is important but falling victim to trends just might be a huge mistake. Trends can be deceiving! It doesn’t matter if the latest designs in the industry use Gotham or Trebuchet, if they don’t go with your brand and your design you don’t have to use it. Pay attention to the design and make sure it’s as perfect as can be.</p>
