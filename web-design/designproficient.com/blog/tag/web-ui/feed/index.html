				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launching a website is the only half route towards online business, the other half is to bring potential customers to your website and stop the audience from driving away. Many small budget and simple sites can keep customers intact whereas many high budget websites are a total flop. The reason lies within the website design and development.</p>
<p>Here are six ways of driving customers away from a website and if your website is following any such pattern it’s time to change to earn more and more happy customers.</p>

<h1>URL is too complicated or misleading</h1>
<p>Complicated URLs never let the audience find your website while searching something of Google. URLs with numbers or tricky name, confusing spelling considered as least professional or tacky. Misleading URLs also play a role in confusing clients, and they don&#8217;t click BUY NOW button.</p>
<h1>Haphazard Landing Page</h1>
<p>Landing page with incorrect and unclear information is the biggest reason for leaving a website right ahead without checking out further information and company`s message. Landing page image and video are the two best chances to attract visitors and provoke them to visit service page or inventory of any website. When images are unorganized, information is not worthy, and the content is chaotic the visitors leave the site within 10 to 15 seconds.</p>
<h1>Pop-ups</h1>
<p>One or two pop-ups are fine, but too many pop-ups are exasperating and annoying. Useless and irrelevant pop-ups will drag the customer’s attention to something else, and many of them will shift to other <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">websites</a>.</p>
<h1>Grammar Errors in Content</h1>
<p>Grammar errors show the unprofessionalism and non-serious attitude of your company. Write simple and straightforward content with no grammar issues rather than finding quality in complex and long sentences.</p>
<h1>Complex Vocabulary</h1>
<p>No one will pay time to check for synonyms before placing an order on a website that’s why complex and rarely used vocabulary will only irritate people by not letting them understand your message. With poor message deliverance, the chances of getting good business are not possible.</p>
<h1>Auto-Music or Video</h1>
<p>Believe it or not auto music and video is a real pain. Firstly, out of nowhere something starts to play no matter you want to watch it or not. Secondly, it increases loading time, and in case of slow internet people can’t scroll or check other pages because of auto pay mode. Usually among multiple tabs, if something unnecessarily starts playing something people without giving a single look to website close that particular tab.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people landing on your website, they do not spend more than five seconds to decide whether to move further or not. Therefore, investing in UX is considered as necessary to gain trust, brand recognition and guarantee user preservation.</p>
<p>For respective purpose you have to follow several technique, some of which I’ve mentioned bellow</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/26/5-amazing-ways-optimize-custom-website-lead-generation/">5 AMAZING WAYS TO OPTIMIZE YOUR CUSTOM WEBSITE FOR LEAD GENERATION</a></p>
<h1>UNIFORM DESIGN</h1>
<p>Once you have decided the design of your application or website, stick on it until the end. Make sure the design you have picked must possess consistency and uniformity. The user should be not get confused in website, whether it is about typography, color or anything. The bold typography with compelling color get more eyeballs and the thing which make them more attracted is consistency. It is your task to be consistent with the aesthetics and construction throughout the development of the app.</p>
<h2>VISUAL HIERARCHY OF CONTENTS</h2>
<p>With uniformity and consistency, also maintain hierarchy or balance in visual contents. The design of the text and icons without including empty spaces inside should be your first option. Maintaining the visual hierarchy is important as it delivers users comfortable experience of readability.</p>
<h2>PERSONALIZE THE UX</h2>
<p>Personalization is when the behavior of past visits is recorded by an app, and stored for retargeting determinations. If a user has specific buying patterns, you can provide them with proposals and deals to assist them with their purchasing decisions. Personalization offers more unique and relevant user experience. The more aligned the experience is with a user’s requirements and inclinations, the <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/App-Design-and-Development">more likely they are to continue to use the application.</a></p>
<h2>OFFER ASSISTANCE</h2>
<p>Offer your users assistance within the app by providing different support options. Users will often search for help in the toolbar or tab bar of an app. Offer multiple ways for users to receive support, including self-serve FAQs and live support through click-to-call buttons.</p>
<h2> QUALITATIVE DATA</h2>
<p>So, you are working really hard on your design and want to examine the effectiveness of your efforts. For that traditional and free analytics are should not be your choice. I will tell you both qualitative and quantitative data are equally important in order to fully grasp your UX and pinpoint opportunities for optimization. Qualitative data allow you to visualize what is actually going on inside your app and how your user behaviors. This way you can improve user experience.</p>
<h2>TRANSPARENCY TO SHARING OPTIONS</h2>
<p>Today, many of are more comfortable of sharing personal <a href="https://www.hswsolutions.com/services/mobile-web-development/mobile-website-vs-apps/">information on devices such as mobile and within apps</a>. It increased concerns about how that data is kept, shared and used.</p>
<p>So, to establish more trustworthy relationship with your users, explain precisely what they’re sharing and with whom. No users want their private content shared on social networks without their awareness or consents, and if that occurs, you’ll not just lose trust, you’re probably also getting a negative review, which has additional downstream effects.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a fashion app or website, do not dare to assume that people on your app will robotically want to share their styling ideas or progress with their Facebook or LinkedIn community. Instead, make sure to offer a variety of sharing choices for your users that they can switch on and off at-will.</p>
<p>So, these are some of techniques you must use to make your users feel like they’re in a right place when they come to your website.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us spend more than two hours online every day using different devices with screens that require near exclusive attention where more than trillion websites and the same quantity of mobile apps are battling for our valuable time and attention. To make sure you achieve maximum attention of people in your website or app, The Web Founders has selected some crucial tactics or advices to make you stand out from the rest with your exceptional interface.</p>
<p>So, let’s drive&#8230;</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/24/change-brand-web-based-social-media-image-utilizing-design/">HOW TO CHANGE YOUR BRAND WEB-BASED SOCIAL MEDIA IMAGE UTILIZING DESIGN?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>1.    BE CAREFUL WITH NEW UI PATTERNS</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/design/10-quick-tips-for-uiux-design/">Do not make your audience to think too hard about the interface elements</a>. Most of the elements are already known to users. By this I meant, CTA should look like CTA, Links should look like links and so on.</p>
<p>There is no need to get too creative with common patterns or designs. It might sound exciting to do something out of the box or unique with them, but that does not mean usable. Usability and creativity need to be well-adjusted.</p>
<h1>2.    BE CAREFUL ABOUT SIMPLICITY</h1>
<p>It takes no longer than five seconds for users to judge your website, or whether they’re interested or not, so just be careful about what you want users to do on your site. Consider things that help you to make it easy to use. For the respective purpose, prefer consistent design, it is more straightforward or familiar for visitors because it reprocesses constituents, shades, and aesthetic to lessen the requirement for visitors to rethink.</p>
<h1>3.    BE DIRECT AND STAY HONEST</h1>
<p>By staying honest with yourself and visitors, you can convey your message with confidence. Honesty with a user works more than your thinking. So, for this purpose consider social proof instead of just talking about potentials. Nothing will upsurge your conversion as utterly as being honest with the customers.</p>
<h1>4.    COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CUSTOMERS</h1>
<p>Knowing who your users are, is crucial to make the interface most comfortable for them. For this, you have to select the audience relevant to your business. For example, if your website is about stylish chic outfits for women, choose women who want to wear such modern clothes. After targeting the audience, research on them to know their preferences and desires.</p>
<h1>5.    THINK HOW USERS WILL USE YOUR INTERFACE</h1>
<p>Before designing interface, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">you need to see how visitors will use your website or interface.</a> People landing on your site use it in two ways:</p>
<p>Directly: interacting with the elements of the product.</p>
<p>Indirectly: interacting with an element external to the product.</p>
<h2>Instances of direct interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Taking a card</li>
<li>Tapping a button</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping an item with a fingertip</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instances of indirect interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using key commands and shortcuts</li>
<li>Indicating and clicking with a mouse</li>
<li>Drawing on a Wacom tablet</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>6.    SET EXPECTATIONS</h1>
<p>Most of the interactions – directly or indirectly – have some consequences and sometimes, also anxiety. But, you can eliminate this anxiety of users by allowing your users know what will happen just after clicking that particular button before they do it. You can do this through thoughtful design. Highlight the CTA button with appropriate color that has strong meaning. Like we all know green is for a ‘go’ and red for ‘stop.’ You can also use widely understood symbols in a blend with the copy.</p>
<h1>7.    GIVE RESPONSE—FAST</h1>
<p>We are living in a world where environment gives us feedback or respond to our every action. Do you remember to know the stimulus and response theory? The theory implicates here &#8212; We speak, and others respond, or they speak, we respond.</p>
<p>When it comes to your website make sure it all happens quick. Any delay over 2-second mark as an interruption and more than that is enough to cause a bounce. So make your site fast and remove all unnecessary barriers for your users.</p>
<h1>8.    RECOGNITION TO RECALL</h1>
<p>This principle is psychological, suggests, if you have many choices, it is not that hard for you to recognize something already known. Recognition principle should be used wisely to make an experience more comfortable for users. The challenge with recognition is to give users familiar elements which they have been exposed to earlier, instead of expecting them to have a creative idea.</p>
<h1>END OF THE LINE</h1>
<p>So, these are some of tips we have gathered from different sources and experts. Hopefully, they will work for your website..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Goals are crucial in life, and one must have. Without which one cannot go with success in his/her life. Goals help you to motivate and focus on the essential things, allow you to measure progress, and help you overcome procrastination</p>
<p><em>Begin with the end (goal) in mind.</em></p>
<p>&#8211; Stephen Covey</p>
<p>Especially, being a designer, you cannot go without setting goals. In fact in designing, if you fail to set a goal, you plan to fail.</p>
<p>Creating a website that appeal masses must be a primary goal of any businessperson or designer. Remember a great site doesn’t only looks good but must have more than it.</p>
<p>So,<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web"> if you’re going to design a website</a> then read this blog carefully.</p>
<p>After spending hours on the internet, I’ve collected some useful goal-setting elements for your new website, so read on:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong> MAKE USER-FRIENDLY WEBSITE:</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Always try to create a user-friendly or user-centric <a href="https://www.cludo.com/blog/search-vs-navigate-people-behave-websites-search-navigate/">website that helps visitors to navigate or search things on the site easily.</a></p>
<p>Try to focus on visibility, maintain the white space on your website and make your site pleasant with visual design. Bring consistency in typography and also use relevant interactive visuals with the text. Give attention to each thing; it can help you produce a user-centric site.</p>
<p>UX sins to be avoided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inconsistency in typography</li>
<li>Use of irrelevant images and videos on site</li>
<li>Neglecting Prototyping</li>
<li>Avoid proper alignments</li>
<li>Give a messy perception of the website to the visitors</li>
</ul>
<p>Your customers or users are everything. Don’t do anything that hurts or harm UX. Just read the canons of UI/UX, and follow them properly while designing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong> KNOW YOUR BRAND AND AUDIENCE</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s your brand persona or niche is? What your targeted customers are? These two questions should be given importance when making a website. As the site is your brand’s online existence in the market, it should represent your brand’s accurate persona and be capable of interacting with the customers/audience.</p>
<p>I’ve already discussed the importance of audience and user-centric site. So I won’t discuss it for long, but the website should be about your brand.</p>
<p>Know:</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>What your business nature is?</p>
<p>How can I stand out my website in the competitive market?</p>
<p>What character traits help me to make site outshine</p>
<p>Consider these questions, address them and make your site accordingly.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> WEBSITE SPEED</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure that your new site is free from extra load. Adding excessive elements/things on the site make it overloaded and take more time to load.</p>
<p>Slow-speed is a UX killer, can drop viewership by 50%. Test your website speed and if it’s running slow then lessen or eliminate excessive elements from the site.</p>
<p>Here are some useful tips to speed up your site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a good host</li>
<li>Optimize large images</li>
<li>Avoid bulky visuals</li>
<li>Minify resources</li>
<li>Enable Compression</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, I would say that creating a website isn’t as simple as you think. You have to start with a SMART goal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web designer must not forget that they have 10 seconds or even less to grab the visitors’ attention on the site. That means they have no chance to make any mistakes while making web designs.</p>
<p>The nonfunctional website is a big headache which is an outcome of our own mistakes. One can deal with it by ignoring the below-mentioned blunders while creating a web design:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong> Making Your Site Overloaded</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Heavy content or adding unnecessary things like excessive pop-ups, advertisements, plug-ins, and visuals can give your site a messy look. In fact, these things would be damaging for your site. Try to do performance/stress testing of your existing site and check if it’s free from load.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong> Not Mobile-Friendly</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to the perfect site, it is not an easy task. It should be both &#8212; desktop and mobile friendly. Unfortunately, most of the designers do not know that more than 40% of sales happen on mobile. And if people cannot approach your site via mobile than it’ll lose a big chance of traffic, ROI or sales. So check out if your site is handy for mobile or tablet users by testing it on suitable mobile-responsive checker tool.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong> Using Inappropriate Typography</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The use of inappropriate typefaces or unreadable fonts (use of too large or too small fonts) on the website is the not-to-do thing that we commonly do.</p>
<p>It is your task to offer people a website which has readable content. Use appropriate font size. Use bright colors against the light background and light colors against dark colored-background.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong> Avoid Simplicity </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Making things overcomplicated on site is another mistake most of us do, that should be sidestepped. With simple layouts, illustration, and the familiar language you can make things easy-to-understand and simple for your customers.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2><strong> Poor Navigating System</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The site built with the strong navigating system is considered as successful. On the other hand, if people find difficulty in searching or getting their required information, they will abandon the site.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.netguru.co/blog/10-ux-tips-to-improve-website-navigation">Creating a navigating system on your site is not enough</a>. Rather one has to maintain its performance. Poorly built navigation bar can make things horrible for your visitors and so for you.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2><strong> Adding Excessive Backlinks</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Adding Backlinks is useful but too many links on your webpage is against strong <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">UI/UX design</a> canon. Excessive backlinks can distract readers to engage with your website. Unfortunately, I’ve seen many people doing this. I would suggest not to add more than two backlinks in a single web page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h2><strong> Ignore Headings- H1 and H2</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the designers ignore the importance of headings and emphasis more on the content; it is UX killer. Remember more than 80% of visitors read the headings of your site and judge content. Aappealing headlines can give you a better chance of higher viewership. The site should possess clear, indulging headings and subheadings through which website can rank.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h2><strong> Having No or Unclear Key Information </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Who are you? What services you’re offering? How you deliver them? How people can contact you?  These are some of the things your visitors may want to know immediately after landing on your website. Unfortunately, most of us missed these things to mention clearly in sites and got poor outcomes in the face of low traffic or sales.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h2><strong> Putting Irrelevant or Less Interactive Visuals</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Images and videos could be more interactive than those wordy texts written on your site if they&#8217;re being used wisely. Most of us, sometimes, emphasizing more on the text do not give importance to the relevancy of the visuals. Remember poor selection of visuals can ruin the overall website design.</p>
<p>So, these are the common but serious mistakes we often use to do while designing. Hopefully you have found these things helpful enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">Everyone wants their website to be successful</a>. Unfortunately, most of us don’t know much about how to make a site stand out in the competitive market.</p>
<p>It is not only a good web-design but also usability that makes your site successful. But, sometimes we neglect the customers’ ease of use and give more importance to other things.</p>
<p>A successful website is one that gets popularity and provides you with significant ROI. It is not always about the design but about the mix of everything that is suitable according to your niche. As you have created the website for customers and users, so it is essential to make it appropriate for them. A user-friendly approach to designing, developments, sorting and content generation can play a vital role in creating a website accessible and popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, people when visiting your site shouldn’t be confused about a single element; whether it is about content, page-loading, navigation, color or anything on site. If visitors get confused or find any difficulty using your site, they leave, and your site will get a poor reputation.</p>
<p>So, if you have been struggling for the user-friendly website, then read mentioned information carefully and try to implement these as well.</p>

<h1></h1>
<h1>1.    MOBILE- FRIENDLY</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today’s world where mobile web browsing becomes more common than desktop. It becomes a necessity to create a mobile-friendly website.</p>
<p>It is a task of a designer to test his/her website both on desktop and mobile. There’re many testing tools available in the market that are considered handy for both newbies and experts.</p>
<p>W3C mobileOK Checker, iPhone, iPad Peek, Gomez, MobiReady, dotMobi Emulator are some of the several tools which allow you to check speed, accessibility and overall performance of the site.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h2>2.    FAST-LOADING</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a web designer or developer, you must know how important your site loading time is. If it takes more than 5 sec to load, then it won’t be considered as a user-friendly site. Moreover delay in page loading may not only affect website’s usability but also it&#8217;s ranking.</p>
<p>Avoiding the additional videos, images, and plugins on the site can work more than wonder for your site. Furthermore, I would also suggest you check your website speed with KeyCDN Speed Test, Pingdom, Gtmetrix or any reliable tool you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3.    CLEARLY-DEFINED AND ORGANIZED STRUCTURE</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the website looks unorganized or cluttered, then users may find hectic to get their required information from the site.</p>
<p>All you can do to make a site organized and synchronized for users are; make your website layout or design simple enough; always put organized or relevant content; add relevant or useful call-to-action to the site, follow a single theme for every page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.    CONSISTENCY</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The website you’re creating should be user-centric. In other words, it should be designed while keeping user’s behavior, choices, preferences, and their comfort in mind.</p>
<p>Users feel comfortable when they find each and everything consistent or relevant on site. It is your job to maintain consistency and familiarity with elements, design, typography, color, navigation on the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5.    VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a visual web design is another way to make your site user-friendly. Visual design is all about how you aesthetically bring color, images, typography and other elements together to improve the user`s experience.</p>
<p>Pulling all the website elements altogether also requires the wise use of white space, line, shapes and showing the hierarchy between different items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6.    STRONG MARKET RESEARCH</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strong market research is essential for creating a user-friendly website, with the help of which you can:</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, there are many other elements you can go through to make your site more user-friendly. But the elements mentioned above are vital which you cannot ignore.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding a designer to work on a specific project seems significantly easy these days. If you know your basics around photoshop and illustrator, chances are you’ll get tons of clients without a problem. However, if you don’t know the essentials to a specific design type, chances are your designs won’t really work for your client. Web UI belongs to a similar class.</p>
<h1><strong>Understanding Web UI</strong></h1>
<p>The user interface for Web Design isn’t as simple as designer a header, a footer, a few sliders and folds in between. The trajectory of Web UI differs from brand to brand. Consider Web UI similar to an ideology.  Your design portrays what your company stands for and that’s why your focus needs to be immense. As a graphic designer, you need to put your heart and soul into designing a web UI that’s near perfection for the brand you’re working on. In this blog, we’ll be assisting you in creating the best Web UI that you can possibly find.</p>

<h2><strong>Focus on the blend between Web UI and UX</strong></h2>
<p>One thing that you need to understand is that good UX is directly proportional to good UI. That’s literally the one statement that can drift you towards success in no time. The user interface needs to go hand in hand with the user experience. From the click of a button to the complete scrolling order on the website, user experience accounts to everything.</p>
<h2><strong>Understand Your Target Market</strong></h2>
<p>Your target market is the industry that you’re targeting to achieve ROI. While some might feel that the target market is important solely for marketing purposes, they’re mistaken. Consider how your targeted audience would react to the design you’ve made. A minimalistic design full of aesthetics might be great for a targeted audience of youngsters and teenagers that are creative; but hey, maybe not for an audience of a mean age between 30 to 40. So, what good is an aesthetic design when your audience doesn’t understand it? Exactly the point.</p>
<h2><strong>Design Consistency Is Key</strong></h2>
<p>Design is nothing but concept and concepts don’t change halfway into the design. This is exactly why Web UI consistency is important as well. From the color tone to the aesthetics being used. Every element being used in the design is essential to the concept one of the many reasons why you need to keep it consistent throughout the design.</p>
<p>All in all, Web UI is important for an ROI that your business targets. At The Web Founders, we take care of Web UI very carefully. Want our experienced web design and development professionals to work on your project? Reach us today and discuss your project.</p>
