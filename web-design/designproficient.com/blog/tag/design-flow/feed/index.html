				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever visited a website or a social media page and immediately felt like you have to leave? We’ve been there. Have you ever looked at a badly designed ad and felt disgusted rather than feeling attracted to it? We’ve been there as well. This is partially because of bad web page aesthetics or in laymen terms, it has a bad design flow.</p>
<h2><strong>What is design flow?</strong></h2>
<p>Design flow is the movement of your eyes on a specific design document. In some places, it also refers to design consistency such as color, images, line height and much more. From web design to ad design, your brand’s beauty is defined by the design flow on the document.</p>
<p>Design flow is the basic understanding of how your users digest the content that you show them. It might sound easy to do but it actually isn’t. Pairing and working hard with the eye movement and understanding the basic ideas of design flow is what you need to pay attention to if you want your design to prosper.</p>

<h2><strong>Importance of verbal and visual flow</strong></h2>
<p>The best design is made up of two essential elements: the first being verbal flow and the second being visual flow. Both verbal and visual flow combine to create excellent design flow. The verbal flow usually refers to the order in which user reads text on your website. This includes eye movement, font used, line height, line length etc. and more.</p>
<p>The visual flow on the other hand refers to the order at which the user looks at the images on the page, the advertisement or any sort of design that you’ve worked on. Together, both verbal and visual flow contribute to excellent results and that’s where you come in.</p>
<p>All in all, working on both of these significant elements can combine to create excellent and outstanding results for your design flow and of course, for your website as well. Work on your flow today or if you need professional help, reach us at The Web Founders.</p>
