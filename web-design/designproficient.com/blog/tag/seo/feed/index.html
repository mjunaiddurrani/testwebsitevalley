				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike paid traffic, <a href="https://www.smartbugmedia.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-direct-and-organic-search-traffic-sources">organic traffic refers to non-paid traffic</a>. It includes traffic from search engines, social media sites, referral traffic, and direct traffic. These are the traffic achieved organically, rather than any source of paid promotion or advertising.</p>
<p>Publishing the relevant and high-quality content on blog and website is one way to boost the organic traffic of your site. This is, in fact, most comfortable and functional technique used for obtaining new visitors on the website. SEO &#8211; search engine optimization is the outlet of online marketing that emphases directly on cultivating and boosting organic traffic.</p>
<p>Now, let’s suppose that Google is starting to choke organic traffic and limiting the visitors that can get to a site after searching. What would happen, then?</p>
<p>It’s not daydreaming. It&#8217;s happening now. Doubting how? Here’s how.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/08/brand-something-logo/">Why Your Brand Is Something Other Than Your Logo</a></p>
<h1>The Knowledge Graph</h1>
<p>Since the establishment, The Knowledge Graph has been getting more popularity. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Google is using the Knowledge Graph to enhance its search engine’s services</a> with information collected from a variety of sources. Moreover, this refers to Google’s central database of information on movies, historical events, locations, and other topics; when a user searches any topic, a box on the right-side of the search engine results page will display relevant information to that topic along with links to Google pages for other related topics.</p>
<p>Now, it can be a long debate with a lot of confusions about whether The Knowledge Graph really steals organic traffic or not. No matter what, it is clear that anyone looking for his needed information in these boxes doesn’t require to click a link for any more information.</p>
<h1>Carousels</h1>
<p>What is Carousel? How it links with Google? To make sure a perfect web experience delivers to all its users. Google offers Carousel, the most valuable improvement which takes local search to the next level. Google carousels help people with information. It is quite similar to the concept of Knowledge Graph. Both tend to help users. For instance, if anyone searches for ‘Rampage,’ He’ll come up with individual entries for Dwayne Johnson, Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman, Jake Lacy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and some other stuff related to his search. Now, every single entry links to another page with more specific information on each cast. Let’s say, the biography, the career, the rewards and the list is endless. Principally, it’s another doorway that makes the Knowledge Graph more influential – while making it less likely, users need to visit external websites to find the information they’re eyeing for.</p>
<h1>Videos and Content</h1>
<p>Search engines like GOOGLE, YAHOO, and BING offer text-based and visual content which people is searching for. Especially Google assures with its videos and content offerings to fulfill people search requirements. By guaranteeing this, Google makes its ownership of YouTube treasured. Users also get engage with content without going on to any other web page.</p>
<p>These are only three things I’ve mentioned; there’re many other things which screaming loudly that Google is taking a step to keep users on Google for an extended period (as long as possible) by offering them required answers on their queries.</p>
<p>Somehow, it is the critical or tensing situation, but that doesn’t apply that one should have to lessen down his investment in search engine optimization. Don’t worry, Google cannot provide everything to its users.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So your boss asks you to audit your Google Analytics Reports, but when you dive headfirst into your accounts, you notice your seemingly robust traffic is… spam. A lot of it. This will likely happen to you at some point in your career, and it will be intensely frustrating. Trying to keep up with ever-evolving spammers is like playing Whack-a-Mole in the dark with one of those little rubber mallets you see in a doctor’s office, and that’s just as exhausting and confusing as it sounds. Fortunately, there’s a quick and pretty simple way to get your spam referrals under control with Google Analytics filters. It won’t solve all your spam problems forever, but it’ll put you on great footing early in 2017. And you deserve that.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/29/5-ux-principle-guide-product-design-product-design-agency/">5 UX PRINCIPLE TO GUIDE YOUR PRODUCT DESIGN FOR PRODUCT DESignageNCY</a></p>
<h1><strong>Create New Views</strong></h1>
<p>The very first thing you should do before you tinker with your account is set up three <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Google Analytics views.</a> The first should be a completely untouched, unfiltered accounting of your website traffic. The second should be a test view, where you’re going to screw around with filters and potentially break everything. The third should be your carefully vetted filtered view, which you’ll use for reporting purposes.</p>
<h2><strong>Google Analytics Filters</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://conversionxl.com/blog/google-analytics-setup-101/">Start by navigating into the Admin panel in your Google Analytics account.</a> After that, select “View Settings,” click the dropdown for “Create New View,” and get all three set up. From there, you can go into “Admin” and “Filters” to create new filters. Easy!</p>
<h2><strong>Set Up Comprehensive Filters</strong></h2>
<p>There are a variety of filters you could use, but for our money it’s tough to beat this guide from Analytics Edge. We’ve used this on our own site and for several clients, and we’ve found it removes 99% of the spam referrals we were seeing upon application. That includes all the most famous players, like semalt and heyclickhere.net.</p>
<h2><strong>Monitor Vigilantly</strong></h2>
<p>Once you have your views and filters set up, you’ll need to watch the test view carefully for a few days to ensure you’re getting the traffic you should be. You can also see any clever spam referrals that are sneaking through. If all is working as it should, apply that exact set of filters to your Filtered view. You can also simply clone the Test view (if you haven’t added any other odd filters) and reap the benefits.</p>
<p>One thing to note: These filters do not apply retroactively, so you’re still going to have to report on historical data with that annoying spam present. One of the easiest ways to do this is to consult your list of referrals, in particular, and look for anything from the Analytics Edge list of common spam sources. You can then then go to Customization and create a filtered report (filtering by Source) that removes those common spam referrals. It’s a little tedious to set these reports up, but it’s worthwhile.</p>
<p>Because spammers are constantly changing their tactics, this is never going to be a set-and-forget solution. Be sure to check resources like Analytics Edge on a regular basis to see what’s changed. If you do spot a new source of spam traffic, add it to your filters. This is the best way to ensure your reporting is based on clean, accurate data. Shockingly, your marketing efforts will benefit from that over the long haul.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">SEO of a website is mandatory for business</a> because it allows consumers to find you easily on Google or other search engines. When are visible on top rankings people don`t have to find you particularly. Your accessibility is improved and you can earn more money.</p>
<p>There are many things you can do to bring your website up to your desiring ranking on Google. So read on:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/09/amp-important-website/https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/09/amp-important-website/">Why AMP is Important for your Website</a></p>
<h1>1.  POWERFUL CONTENT WITH WISE USE OF KEYWORDS</h1>
<p>Being a website owner, it is up to you what type of content you’re putting on your site. Whether it is about technology, science, health, politics or any other topic. Just make sure you’re putting high-quality material relevant to your business.</p>
<p>Adding relevant content isn’t just enough instead you should also add keyword on the page. To understand the strategy of behind which keyword would be suitable and which is not, just think about your customers or readers. How they’ll search your content from Google and what keywords they’ll write. After acknowledging right keywords apply them on your webpage, wisely. Remember adding excessive keywords can be destructive for your site. Don’t add more than six keywords in a single page.</p>
<h2>2.    UPDATE YOUR SITE</h2>
<p>Try to update your content on a  regular basis. Frequent posting on the website not only give your site a new life but also allow visitors to view or share fresh content. In fact, most of the website’s owners follow the same tactic just to assure if they’re getting chance of better ranking in Google. Wikipedia is one of the famous sites which updates its content very frequently.</p>
<h2>3.    SPEED UP YOUR WEBSITE</h2>
<p>Your web-page loading speed is an important matter which you cannot take for granted. If a website takes more than 2-sec in loading then probably it will lose a high chance of ranking in future. The delay in page loading can bother users, adversely affects bounce rate, conversion, sales and overall hurts site’s SEO.</p>
<p>Don’t worry. You can easily protect your site by lessening or eliminating all the bulky-size videos, images, and additional plugins.</p>
<h2>4.  ADD BACKLINKS</h2>
<p>Uploading a high-quality content with relevant keywords is essential. But, adding outbound links on the content can also work more than wonders.</p>
<p>Just make sure, you’re linking an appropriate or relevant site on your webpage. Don’t add extra backlinks, as excessive backlinks discourage readers to grasp the content.</p>
<p>Outbound Links not only help you with your site ranking but also help you to build a strong relationship with other sites.</p>
<h2>5.  READABILITY</h2>
<p>It is a mistake to think, ‘intricate, complex and difficult text as classy’ about which designer has to be very clear. Remember, it is not an appropriate way to go. Instead, you should use clear, simple, vague-less, familiar, and readable text or content to grab visitors‘attention.</p>
<p>Making your web content up to the canons of readability is another way to get better position or ranking in Google. According to some experts, <a href="https://www.protofuse.com/blog/details/6-seo-reasons-why-blogs-arent-ranking-getting-traffic/">Google considers readability of your website in raking.</a></p>
<p>You can check your site’s readability through these sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Readable.io</li>
<li>Webpagefx</li>
<li>Readabilityformula</li>
<li>Online-utility</li>
<li>The writer</li>
<li>Support.office</li>
</ul>
<p>Improving a site ranking isn’t that difficult just use the tips as mentioned above. Hopefully, they will work enough for your site ranking.</p>

<h1>Research</h1>
<p>It is evident that marketers conduct market research before creating a plan. But sometimes their research is not multi-directional. Lack of research means you have very few points to reply when client start cross-questions regarding your presented marketing plan.</p>
<h2>Backup planning</h2>
<p>Confidence in your planning skills and your presented strategy is a good sign, but still, you should have a backup plan. Market condition and trends can change at any point. Also, it takes very minimum time when a competitor company can change the whole game of market. In that case, you cannot make excuses for your client. The ideal way is to implement your back up plan in that case.  When you present a backup along with a frontline<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing"> marketing strategy</a>, your client will surely admire your futuristic approach.</p>
<h2> Cover maximum resources</h2>
<p>Potential clients are not restricted to one domain. Today`s market is vast and dislocated as well. When a marketer picks out target audience to pitch the advertisement of the brand, it’s highly challenging to distribute the marketing amount in all domains. It is suggested to cover maximum resources available. Social media, <a href="https://www.businessmarketingblog.org/top-10-reasons-to-use-paid-search-marketing/">paid advertisements</a>, TV commercials, etc. all are important.</p>
<p>Active participation and showcase of the brand`s existence can make any marketing plan a big hit for the market because people prefer to buy the brands that show actively communicate with them through different means.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you find mentioned points essential to consider while preparing a marketing plan for any brand and will pay attention to all of them as well.</p>

<h1>Choose Specific Topic for Site</h1>
<p>Pick any one topic and try to stick with it.  You cannot appeal every other person. The same goes for the website. Therefore, the designer should focus on targeted audience and one topic. Think about your website’s purpose, choose the specific topic, set target audience demographics and make your site accordingly.</p>
<h2>Use Keywords Wisely</h2>
<p>Keywords are the king, serves the important purpose. But the wise use of keyword can only help you with your site ranking. That particular thing of your site (the topic of the site) should be mentioned where they matter; in title and description. The designer should also add keywords not only in texts but on the images. H1, H2, H3 are just not headings but have other functions as well. They can change the game of keyword settings.</p>
<h2>Add Backlinks to the page</h2>
<p><a href="https://yoast.com/successful-linkbuilding-strategy/">Link-building is another strategy</a> that works. You should add links of other relevant pages on your web page. Adding backlinks to the page help you increase the site rankings.</p>
<h2>Avoid Unnecessary Content</h2>
<p>Delays in page loading can be harmful to the site because if users find any difficulty in loading they will quickly switch to any other website. So, while designing a website just be careful about the addition of non-essential things. Enormous visual content, too much content and even unnecessary plugins can be a reason for the delay while loading a website.</p>
<h2>Update Regularly</h2>
<p>Update your site frequently because if your website’s content is getting older then it is also losing a chance of ranking. Most of the companies update their sites just to ensure if they get a better chance of ranking.</p>
<p>Fresh content is a fuel of the site, which not only renews your site but also works well for social media as people want to read and share new content and eventually benefits<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing"> SEO.</a></p>
<h2>Use Genuine and Quality Content</h2>
<p>The designer should prefer quality content instead of stealing others material. Stealing content is easy and a quick way to start a business website but it can ruin your investment as well. Copied content is not SEO friendly and Google marks it as spam.</p>
<p>Add unique articles or blogs, use the interactive visual content to appeal visitors. Even site with unique content is 50% more likely to get chance of getting more visitors than the site without genuine content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Make your site Easy-to-navigate for the visitors</h2>
<p><a href="https://bemorewithless.com/simplicityblogs/">Minimalism and simplicity</a> are the two things that designer should keep in mind while designing. If your site is simple, users will find no difficulty in navigation. Define each category or sub-category clearly for the users. Add ‘Call to action’ to the site – a phrase that eases viewers to take immediate action, it could be; call us, message us, add to the cart, subscribe now.</p>
<h2>Forget black hat SEO and Prefer White hat SEO</h2>
<p>Use white hat SEO tactics if you want your site to be rank for long on the Google. Even using tactics like article spinning, reporting competitors’ page considered as an illegal, against to the SEO rules that surely ruin your site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building a website that stand-alone in the market is a dream of every new designer. But it is not just the matter of knowing few coding, rather you also have to focus on Site’s SEO too.</p>
