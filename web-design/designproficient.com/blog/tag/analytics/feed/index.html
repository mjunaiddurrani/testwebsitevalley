				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So your boss asks you to audit your Google Analytics Reports, but when you dive headfirst into your accounts, you notice your seemingly robust traffic is… spam. A lot of it. This will likely happen to you at some point in your career, and it will be intensely frustrating. Trying to keep up with ever-evolving spammers is like playing Whack-a-Mole in the dark with one of those little rubber mallets you see in a doctor’s office, and that’s just as exhausting and confusing as it sounds. Fortunately, there’s a quick and pretty simple way to get your spam referrals under control with Google Analytics filters. It won’t solve all your spam problems forever, but it’ll put you on great footing early in 2017. And you deserve that.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/29/5-ux-principle-guide-product-design-product-design-agency/">5 UX PRINCIPLE TO GUIDE YOUR PRODUCT DESIGN FOR PRODUCT DESignageNCY</a></p>
<h1><strong>Create New Views</strong></h1>
<p>The very first thing you should do before you tinker with your account is set up three <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Google Analytics views.</a> The first should be a completely untouched, unfiltered accounting of your website traffic. The second should be a test view, where you’re going to screw around with filters and potentially break everything. The third should be your carefully vetted filtered view, which you’ll use for reporting purposes.</p>
<h2><strong>Google Analytics Filters</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://conversionxl.com/blog/google-analytics-setup-101/">Start by navigating into the Admin panel in your Google Analytics account.</a> After that, select “View Settings,” click the dropdown for “Create New View,” and get all three set up. From there, you can go into “Admin” and “Filters” to create new filters. Easy!</p>
<h2><strong>Set Up Comprehensive Filters</strong></h2>
<p>There are a variety of filters you could use, but for our money it’s tough to beat this guide from Analytics Edge. We’ve used this on our own site and for several clients, and we’ve found it removes 99% of the spam referrals we were seeing upon application. That includes all the most famous players, like semalt and heyclickhere.net.</p>
<h2><strong>Monitor Vigilantly</strong></h2>
<p>Once you have your views and filters set up, you’ll need to watch the test view carefully for a few days to ensure you’re getting the traffic you should be. You can also see any clever spam referrals that are sneaking through. If all is working as it should, apply that exact set of filters to your Filtered view. You can also simply clone the Test view (if you haven’t added any other odd filters) and reap the benefits.</p>
<p>One thing to note: These filters do not apply retroactively, so you’re still going to have to report on historical data with that annoying spam present. One of the easiest ways to do this is to consult your list of referrals, in particular, and look for anything from the Analytics Edge list of common spam sources. You can then then go to Customization and create a filtered report (filtering by Source) that removes those common spam referrals. It’s a little tedious to set these reports up, but it’s worthwhile.</p>
<p>Because spammers are constantly changing their tactics, this is never going to be a set-and-forget solution. Be sure to check resources like Analytics Edge on a regular basis to see what’s changed. If you do spot a new source of spam traffic, add it to your filters. This is the best way to ensure your reporting is based on clean, accurate data. Shockingly, your marketing efforts will benefit from that over the long haul.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An on-point strategy, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">unique design</a>, and flawless development are the key ingredients to build a promising mobile app. However, application analytics is the ultimate tool that evaluates how well the app design and strategy has been executed and how it is performing in the market.</p>
<p>Here are 6 analytics strategies that you can use to measure the performance of your mobile app.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/02/02/b2b-centric-web-design-important/">Why B2B Centric Web Design is Important</a></p>
<h1>1.    Start using App Analytics during app development</h1>
<p>Analytics should start right from the start, even before your app is ready for the launch. From ideation to design and development, there are a lot of steps involved, each with its own specific data that can be analyzed for your own benefit. App analysis right from the beginning of app development process will allow you to test, assess and troubleshoot issues and ensure that the first version you release is free of any loops or discrepancies.</p>
<h2>2.    Identify the usage pattern</h2>
<p>You may have a clear idea about the usage of your app, but your users may not necessarily conform to it. After you have released your application in the market, there is no way you can make the users follow the usage pattern recommended by you. This is why it is essential for you to keep tabs on how different users are using your app and for what purpose. This will allow you to identify the modifications and upgrades you need to make in the coming versions.</p>
<h2>3.    Specify relevant KPIs</h2>
<p>All apps are not same and different apps are created to serve different purposes. Before you release your app in the market, make sure you have devised an analytics strategy based on <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-blogging-metrics-kpis-list">specific KPIs</a> relevant to the genre of your app.</p>
<h2>4.    Track Downloads</h2>
<p>The magnitude of downloads is one of the core parameters to evaluate the performance of an application. This is the reason why many businesses, companies and app developers are only focused on getting maximum downloads. While this certainly is important, you also need to identify the type of users downloading your app. This will help you analyze whether your app is attracting the right audience, in line with your projected strategy.</p>
<h2>5.    Ratings and Reviews</h2>
<p>Reviews, <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/07/use-reviews-and-testimonials-for-marketing.html">ratings and testimonials</a> play a key role in influencing customers’ decision. It is estimated that around 88% users look for rating and online reviews left by other users before downloading an app or software. Another fact is that a majority of the users who have downloaded an app and are satisfied with it do not leave any review – which means there’s a lot of potential you can garner by encouraging your users to rate your app and provide their reviews on your website and app stores.</p>
<h2>6.    Target versus Return Reporting</h2>
<p>Target versus returns analysis provides an insight into the profitability of your app, as in whether it is meeting the strategic targets and to what extent is it generating returns. However, the key to an on-point target versus returns analysis is to set realistic goals and tie them to a specific time frame so as to assess results and identify whether or not the app is performing up to par.</p>
