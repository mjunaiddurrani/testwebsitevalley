				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning new techniques is a good thing to do for every novice or seasoned web developer to keep him/her updated with ongoing technologies. Web development is a complex technical field which requires every developer to keep learning new things to increase his proficiency and to hold a solid grasp of expertise in coding and programming websites.</p>
<p>Here are the three modern techniques every web developer should know about:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/08/30/ux-ui-design/">The Difference between UX and UI design</a></p>
<h1>CSS 3 media queries</h1>
<p>Css3 media queries are the fundamental building block elements of a <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">responsive website design</a>. These are syntax command code in a cascading style sheet module used to define set of parameters to modify the desktop screen resolution sizes and mobile browser viewport width.</p>
<p>The CSS3 media queries are used to apply styles with the CSS modules by using the @media and @import at-rules. It is also used to target specific media for the &lt;link&gt;, &lt;source&gt;, and other HTML elements. Moreover, it is further used to test media queries by using the Window.match media () and MediaQueryList.addlistener () JavaScript methods.</p>
<p>Following is the code to illustrate the CSS media queries with example:</p>
<p>@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {</p>
<p>#container {</p>
<p>Width: 320px;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Header h1#logo a {</p>
<p>Width: 320px;</p>
<p>Height: 44px;</p>
<p>Background: url (image-small.jpg) no-repeat 0 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Font resizing with REM</h1>
<p>Font resizing is a root element in Cascading style sheet to make it easier to increase and decrease the size of fonts by inches. It provides a relative measurement of length in the HTML element and defines in a percentage in the HTML body and h1 header tag.</p>
<p>Here is the font resizing code with root em:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Html {font-size: 62.5 %;}</p>
<p>Body {font-size: 1.4rem ;} /* =14px */</p>
<p>h1 {font-size: 2.4rem ;} /* =24px */</p>
<h1>Cache pages for offline usage</h1>
<p>Cache manifest is a new feature in the Html 5 web element which helps users to easily visit the website while being offline. It helps in navigating offline web pages with a faster loading speed and reduced load server.</p>
<p>Following is the code for offline cache pages:</p>
<p>Add-Type text/cache-manifest .manifest</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CACHE MANIFEST</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CACHE</p>
<p>index.html</p>
<p>style.css</p>
<p>image.jpg</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;html manifest=&#8221;/offline. Manifest&#8221;&gt;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard the saying, Content is fire; web design is its fuel? If so, you must know the importance of content is as same as the design of a site is. A content that is not unique, fresh, genuine, as per your customers’ preferences cannot give any benefit to you. Holding the gigantic significance, unique content is something you cannot overlook its importance in catching numerous eyeballs from people coming from different rivalries. Unique content is original and not duplicated anywhere else.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h1>Unique Content Can Educate People about Your Professional Website</h1>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Content is a resource of information which can be used to educate search engines about what your business caters to and how unique you are. It is important to bear in mind your website is depicted to search engines and must have to communicate your website’s purpose accurately. Try to optimize your website and permit search engine to know when to show your site in the results for appropriate search queries.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Unique Content Can Help You Raise in Search Engine</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keywords are considered to be essential for ranking. Keywords refer that you are looking for online prominence and that best define your products and services. Content should always reflect your keyword strategy. Content is a great place to highlight the relevant keywords in a natural, harmonious way and to support search engines make the connection between the keywords and your website that you have incorporated in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Unique Content Can Help You with Social Validation</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The importance of customers in business progress is undeniable. Earning their trust is essential to get that mark you always dream of. In chasing this dream, you have to give them the thing they want more from you: Social validation. I have seen numerous web pages and blog posts ranking well due to the social validation. This can be attained by trial and error method and lots of consideration. For business ranging from small to medium-sized business, the only way you can get social validation is by the quality and unique content writing.</p>
<p><strong>So, How To Write A Unique And Appealing Content?</strong></p>
<p>Here are few guidelines to incorporate in your writing style:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never steal a word from other resource. Stay away from plagiarism by citing research and using your own words to explain the topic.</li>
<li>Do not stick on one resource. Better to use multiple sources when researching.</li>
<li>Give your text a unique structure.</li>
<li>Incorporate your individual style.</li>
<li>Keep reliance on your rational thinking. Explain things how you comprehend them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>LAST THOUGHT</u></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">When your content is high in quality</a>, it delivers value. When your content provides people with what they are on the lookout for, they lean towards to engage with your content through numerous means. And this is how your content will earn it&#8217;s acknowledged and helps your website raise in search engine results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">Everyone wants their website to be successful</a>. Unfortunately, most of us don’t know much about how to make a site stand out in the competitive market.</p>
<p>It is not only a good web-design but also usability that makes your site successful. But, sometimes we neglect the customers’ ease of use and give more importance to other things.</p>
<p>A successful website is one that gets popularity and provides you with significant ROI. It is not always about the design but about the mix of everything that is suitable according to your niche. As you have created the website for customers and users, so it is essential to make it appropriate for them. A user-friendly approach to designing, developments, sorting and content generation can play a vital role in creating a website accessible and popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, people when visiting your site shouldn’t be confused about a single element; whether it is about content, page-loading, navigation, color or anything on site. If visitors get confused or find any difficulty using your site, they leave, and your site will get a poor reputation.</p>
<p>So, if you have been struggling for the user-friendly website, then read mentioned information carefully and try to implement these as well.</p>

<h1></h1>
<h1>1.    MOBILE- FRIENDLY</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today’s world where mobile web browsing becomes more common than desktop. It becomes a necessity to create a mobile-friendly website.</p>
<p>It is a task of a designer to test his/her website both on desktop and mobile. There’re many testing tools available in the market that are considered handy for both newbies and experts.</p>
<p>W3C mobileOK Checker, iPhone, iPad Peek, Gomez, MobiReady, dotMobi Emulator are some of the several tools which allow you to check speed, accessibility and overall performance of the site.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h2>2.    FAST-LOADING</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a web designer or developer, you must know how important your site loading time is. If it takes more than 5 sec to load, then it won’t be considered as a user-friendly site. Moreover delay in page loading may not only affect website’s usability but also it&#8217;s ranking.</p>
<p>Avoiding the additional videos, images, and plugins on the site can work more than wonder for your site. Furthermore, I would also suggest you check your website speed with KeyCDN Speed Test, Pingdom, Gtmetrix or any reliable tool you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3.    CLEARLY-DEFINED AND ORGANIZED STRUCTURE</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the website looks unorganized or cluttered, then users may find hectic to get their required information from the site.</p>
<p>All you can do to make a site organized and synchronized for users are; make your website layout or design simple enough; always put organized or relevant content; add relevant or useful call-to-action to the site, follow a single theme for every page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.    CONSISTENCY</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The website you’re creating should be user-centric. In other words, it should be designed while keeping user’s behavior, choices, preferences, and their comfort in mind.</p>
<p>Users feel comfortable when they find each and everything consistent or relevant on site. It is your job to maintain consistency and familiarity with elements, design, typography, color, navigation on the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5.    VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a visual web design is another way to make your site user-friendly. Visual design is all about how you aesthetically bring color, images, typography and other elements together to improve the user`s experience.</p>
<p>Pulling all the website elements altogether also requires the wise use of white space, line, shapes and showing the hierarchy between different items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6.    STRONG MARKET RESEARCH</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strong market research is essential for creating a user-friendly website, with the help of which you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/55-ways-to-increase-engagement-with-your-target-audience/">Target customers that are relevant to your brand.</a></li>
<li>Consider approaches that can give you good Return on Investment.</li>
<li>Conduct prototype testing which will allow you to avoid future errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, there are many other elements you can go through to make your site more user-friendly. But the elements mentioned above are vital which you cannot ignore.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AMP refers to Accelerated Mobile Pages and its now being backed by Google as well. When we open a website on the desktop it loads comparatively faster than our cell phones. It is because your desktops have supportive programs. Also, RAM and memory are more than that of mobiles. Another factor is that processors of desktops are faster and efficient than mobiles. All these reasons not only affect the speed of loading of website but also disturbs the user experience.</p>
<p>According to Rudy Galfi, AMP’s project PM affirms</p>
<p><em>“The median load time for AMP is 0.7 seconds, the time it takes for your eye to blink twice. By contrast, the median load time for non-AMPs is 22.0 seconds, the time it takes for you to leave the site and never come back.”</em></p>
<p>Here are some benefits of AMPs and how they can affect the commercial world.</p>
