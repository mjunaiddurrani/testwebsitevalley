				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All businesses today strive to increase the profit margin in order to smoothly manage and run their operations, expand services and offer a comparative advantage to the customers. However, this is easier said than done, especially in today’s modern and fast paced world where competition is tough.</p>
<p>Successfully aligning both the sales and marketing teams within a company is a practice which is as old as the entire corporate structure itself. For numerous companies, the marketing department’s job is to generate successful leads and the sale’s team’s job to turn them into loyal customers.</p>
<p>According to theory, it is important that both the marketing alongside the sales teams, work in tandem, to align shared goals as well as roles to ensure ROI becomes the responsibility or the organization, rather than that of individual teams.</p>
<p>Unluckily, building a solid team around marketing and sales alignment is usually easier said than done. Nevertheless, here are 5 brilliant ideas using which you can effectively implement an amazing strategy and make sure everyone keeps and works towards common goals and targets.</p>

<h1>Determine the Company’s Marketing Goals</h1>
<p>Even though this might sound a little cliché, but it is advised that you “Plan your work, and work your plan.” Developing a strategic plan is going to help your organization go a long way towards getting off to a very good start. When you are determining the marketing goals, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What new products and/or services will I be launching this year?</li>
<li>What is the overall revenue goal for this year?</li>
<li>What key metrics are extremely important when it comes to measuring my sales and marketing success?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Reduce Your Expenses</h1>
<p>One of the tried and tested ways using which you can bring up your sales is by reducing your expenses. For examples, you may want to consider having shared offices instead of having your own expansive and expensive space. Keep a track of your account books and identify where your money is going. After analyzing this, look for various different ways to reduce all the expenses incurred without actually compromising the business.</p>
<h1>Improve Your Customer Relationship</h1>
<p>You should also be active when it comes to improving your relationship with your clients. Focus on initiating loyalty. When consumers are loyal, you can trust that they will support your products, even when you increase prices, given that the quality remains top-notch. Research about your clients, think about customer segmentation, learn about what they need, and design approaches that will allow you to deliver a high level of consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is very easy to be overwhelmed when it comes to considering all the various different marketing choices and paths accessible to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">grow your business</a>. Nonetheless, with all signs pointing towards constant economic growth worldwide in the year 2018, there is still time to create a plan to increase revenue this year.</p>
