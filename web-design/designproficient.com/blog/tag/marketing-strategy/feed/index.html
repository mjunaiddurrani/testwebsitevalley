				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All businesses today strive to increase the profit margin in order to smoothly manage and run their operations, expand services and offer a comparative advantage to the customers. However, this is easier said than done, especially in today’s modern and fast paced world where competition is tough.</p>
<p>Successfully aligning both the sales and marketing teams within a company is a practice which is as old as the entire corporate structure itself. For numerous companies, the marketing department’s job is to generate successful leads and the sale’s team’s job to turn them into loyal customers.</p>
<p>According to theory, it is important that both the marketing alongside the sales teams, work in tandem, to align shared goals as well as roles to ensure ROI becomes the responsibility or the organization, rather than that of individual teams.</p>
<p>Unluckily, building a solid team around marketing and sales alignment is usually easier said than done. Nevertheless, here are 5 brilliant ideas using which you can effectively implement an amazing strategy and make sure everyone keeps and works towards common goals and targets.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/08/02/use-social-media-marketing-business/">HOW TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING FOR YOUR BUSINESS</a></p>
<h1>Determine the Company’s Marketing Goals</h1>
<p>Even though this might sound a little cliché, but it is advised that you “Plan your work, and work your plan.” Developing a strategic plan is going to help your organization go a long way towards getting off to a very good start. When you are determining the marketing goals, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What new products and/or services will I be launching this year?</li>
<li>What is the overall revenue goal for this year?</li>
<li>What key metrics are extremely important when it comes to measuring my sales and marketing success?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Reduce Your Expenses</h1>
<p>One of the tried and tested ways using which you can bring up your sales is by reducing your expenses. For examples, you may want to consider having shared offices instead of having your own expansive and expensive space. Keep a track of your account books and identify where your money is going. After analyzing this, look for various different ways to reduce all the expenses incurred without actually compromising the business.</p>
<h1>Improve Your Customer Relationship</h1>
<p>You should also be active when it comes to improving your relationship with your clients. Focus on initiating loyalty. When consumers are loyal, you can trust that they will support your products, even when you increase prices, given that the quality remains top-notch. Research about your clients, think about customer segmentation, learn about what they need, and design approaches that will allow you to deliver a high level of consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is very easy to be overwhelmed when it comes to considering all the various different marketing choices and paths accessible to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">grow your business</a>. Nonetheless, with all signs pointing towards constant economic growth worldwide in the year 2018, there is still time to create a plan to increase revenue this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No need to mention that if you are running any business, you have to face new challenges to your business and customers. The common problems could be: lacking website traffic, lacking users’ interests, sales funnel deficit, and deprived lead conversion. It is sad to deal with such issues after spending much time, money and considerations to the business.</p>
<p>The good news is that the use of several marketing tactics can help you solve these problems across the board. With its flexibility helps you <a href="https://www.intechnic.com/blog/how-to-set-smart-business-goals-for-a-business-website/">make improvements and reach the goals that you have set earlier for your business</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dig more in-depth at the common business problems and how marketing can play a significant role in problem-solving.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/12/5-unsung-myths-marketing/">5 UNSUNG MYTHS ABOUT MARKETING</a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Content Marketing Campaign</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fresh, new, genuine content is like a fuel for your business. It can work to resolve many of the issues that your business is facing and presents you with a chance to position your business in the center of your target audience. If the content is compelling, interesting and on the recent topics, it can earn more attention. The user-centric is the only things which you cannot take as an optional. Write a genuine and fresh blog or web content relevant to your business. Make your content highly-relevant to your potential readers’ preferences. Understand their opinions and think about their likes and dislikes before writing any content. The headlines and titles get more attention and require more consideration.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Properly Optimized Web Content</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After preparing the content, get all your attention towards optimization. Proper optimization is a need. Incorporate relevant keywords into the content. Here, you cannot go recklessly. You have to be very wise and responsible about what keywords should be added on a content. For this, research thoroughly your audience about what word(s) they will use to search you on the search engine. Incorporate them into your content. However, do not use more than three or four keywords in one webpage. Exceed can be harmful, and even Google can penalize you for misusing keywords. So, be very careful.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Short and Long Tail Keywords</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This point is the extension of the second one, but I am writing this separately to emphasizing more. Keywords are king for any content, and the importance of them cannot be neglected. There are two types of keywords: Short-tail keywords and Long-tail Keywords. Short-tail keywords are search maxims with one word, whereas long-tail keywords are phrases with three-four words. Which type is more productive, is crucial to understand. According to SEO experts, the use of Long-tail keyword is more common, and so it should be incorporated into content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Social Media Network</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Having a social media presence helps you achieving more business recognition and customers</a>. In fact, social media is like a breeding ground which should be used wisely. Business owners, sometimes, lack users’ interests and find it difficult to get more conversion. Here in such situation, the platform helps you by providing you more recognition with the help of its 2.8 billion active users.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Email Marketing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With the technological advancement and social media presence, it seems like the use of email is decreasing. However, still, email marketing has its own importance when it comes to solving common problems your business face, such as sales funnel insufficiency and poor lead conversion. This type of marketing helps you a lot. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or ask sales or contributions, and is meant to build devotion, faith, or brand awareness. It is also crucial for building relationships with prospects, leads, and new customers as it gives you a chance to communicate directly to them and convince, in their inbox, at a time that is suitable for them.</p>
<p>Finally, I would say that one who knows even little about the marketing industry cannot refuse the significance of it. The industry is booming and getting more authority on each successive day. In fact, the future also seems more prosperous.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Facebook is an important platform not only for social interactions but also for businesses</a>. It helps companies to reach their target audience and even to the competitors in the market. Unfortunately, Facebook’s News Feed algorithm is in a continuous state of uncertainty about what should be done.</p>
<p>The platform with more than 2 billion monthly active users, becoming critical or complicated for business owners to control their entrepreneurship and to have a presence on this platform.</p>
<p>If your business needs help staying up to date with the latest Facebook trends or making the most of its reach on the network, then I’ll let you know that it would be tough this time!</p>
<p>Facebook is changing the algorithm that functions the news feed, which presents a computer-curated selection of posts from other people and pages.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/14/6-easy-tips-increase-sales-website/">6 EASY TIPS TO INCREASE SALES ON YOUR WEBSITE</a></p>
<h1>How this new Facebook Algorithm Affect Me and My Business?</h1>
<ul>
<li>This new feed will display things from the people who are important to you than the things that are important for you.</li>
<li>From now, You will see less annoying stuff like fewer click bait and share=like posts, etc., as the new algorithm of Facebook restricts the number of posts, even though they may have many likes and shares, don’t encourage community engagement through conversation.</li>
<li>You will be going to see comparatively less Facebook videos that annoyed you. They will not blast you with fantastic max volume music and overzealous rattling sales pitches.</li>
<li>Your Facebook posts that people comment on will get more views.</li>
<li>You will see more posts from the people you know, or you love. Especially from those friends and family who you talk to the most. This is a step back, though not a full redaction, of a previous update, which began limiting the number of friends’ posts you see on your news feed.</li>
<li>You will see fewer posts and videos about topics you are interested in and more posts from friends you are interested in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your Facebook Business Strategies Will Have To Change:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The persona of your business will be damage, and your business’ voice will lessen down unless you change your Facebook Business Strategies. Here are some of the reasons:</li>
<li>An organic post which is not paid from brand pages and businesses will be shown a smaller amount than they have been in the previous.</li>
<li>Even the bulk amount of Likes and shares will not help your posts as they used to.</li>
<li>The chances are you may have to buy ads to get the same result, but your ads are more likely to perform better than they used to be.</li>
<li>You need some comments on your Facebook posts to achieve the same amount of popularity once you have earlier. This may not be much of a problem for pages with a massive following, but it can hurt small business pages.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Some Important Strategies:</strong></h2>
<h2>Increase your Social Perspectives or Horizons</h2>
<p>You would not waste your precious time with people who don’t like or ignore you. You can find your new friends. No exceptions with social media. Use some of the time you devote to Facebook to explore other options such as Linkedin, Twitter and YouTube are some names.</p>
<h2>Use More Live Video</h2>
<p>In future, Facebook will be presenting not more video to users, but that doesn’t reckon for live video. Live videos are engaging and Facebook like that. It will rank a live video in your business supporters’ feeds.</p>
<h2>Create Engaging Content</h2>
<p>Always remember that Content is king. So, make sure you are <a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/26-ways-to-create-engaging-content/">making a content that is valuable and engaging</a>. In fact, Facebook favor posts that get more eyeballs. You have to write compelling content relevant to the niche. Likes and shares are essential but not the primary factor in post popularity once the change is carried out. You need content that stimulates the commenting type of engagement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to increasing traffic to your professional website, you can’t afford to put all your eggs in one basket! Days gone by, it was easy to drive tons of traffic by relying on one or two traffic boosting strategies, not today. The more you have streams of driving traffic, the more you will have a chance to improve your site conversion.</p>
<p>There are thousands of ways to groom website traffic, but, I have covered several usual ways using which you will surely generate traffic to your website by just spending a few minutes:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/11/3-awesome-design-techniques-create-better-cta-button/">3 Awesome Design Techniques for Create Better CTA Button</a></p>
<h1>Optimize Your Custom Website</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Optimizing a website to SEO tends to increase website’s ranking.</a> Choose the relevant words to target in your SEO campaigns to increase website traffic. Try to target relevant keywords with searcher’s intent in mind. And if you offer any services, create content around these keywords.</p>
<h1>Give a New Life to Your Old Content and Update It</h1>
<p>This tactic is becoming more popular than ever.</p>
<p>No point in posting more and more articles or blogs on the website if no one will ever read them. Instead, you should discover the web pages that are already giving you traffic, and it is better to update those pages for traffic growth. In fact, Google considers websites with the updated content and will rank them higher in a search engine. Many sites are using this tactic, and you should have to follow them.</p>
<h1>Prefer Some Paid Social Media Promotion</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/importance-social-media-business/">Each social media platform works significantly in advertising and cheaper than many other means of advertising</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter cover almost every audience, allow you to know about competitors and stand out among them. Pinterest is perfect for visual-related businesses, designs, etc. LinkedIn is the best option to target business professionals and getting a high ROI. Choose the best platform according to your niche.</p>
<h1>BLOGGING – Perfect Public Relations Tool</h1>
<p>Blogging drives high traffic. According to the case study blogging can result in 300% traffic boost in just 56 days. And this isn’t rare; another company also ran a similar experiment with even better results.</p>
<p>When you write a blog determine the main keywords that bring visitors to the website. Publish a quality blog post on a consistent basis. Ask questions that are related to your topic and also allow their responses and views. Establish a strong network with other blogs. Share your blog post on different social media platforms.</p>
<h1>Use Email Marketing, It Still Matters</h1>
<p>Email marketing is another usual way to drive traffic to the website. A newsletter is a fantastic tool for driving traffic. Make sure that you have a newsletter opt-in on your site. I would suggest you to use Drip. It’s free and fun to use.</p>
<h1>Make Sure Your Site Is Fast and Responsive</h1>
<p>It is very important for your website to be responsive on both devices: desktop and mobile. Along with responsiveness, the website should be fast as if it fails to load within three seconds then your bounce rate will sky high.</p>
<h1>Keep an Eye on Analytics Data</h1>
<p>Do not take your site analytics for granted, study analytics of your site and use extracted information in improving your content strategies. For the respective purpose, Google analytics is a reliable tool use to optimize website performance and conversions.</p>
<p>Consider mentioned ways to groom your website traffic. Hopefully, they’ll take your website traffic to the sky.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.brackenmarketing.com/blog/content-backbone-biopharma-digital-marketing">Social media has now become the backbone of marketing activities</a>. Various platforms are available where ideas, products, services and brand`s names are promoted. Almost all kinds of audiences are available on social media and marketers only have to drive their attention towards a certain goal.</p>
<p>Like any other medium, there are several marketing trends of social media as well which kept on changing with time and market nature. Selection of right trends at the right moment as per the market requirements related to the product or brand is the key to success in the world of social media.</p>
<p>Here are five unexpected social media marketing trends of 2018.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/27/7-ultimate-logo-design-trend-2018-logo-design-agency/">THE 7 ULTIMATE LOGO DESIGN TREND IN 2018 FOR LOGO DESignageNCY</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Negative marketing by your social media company</h1>
<p>There is a boost of negative or immoral activities to promote the brand or product. Even popular names of the market are involved in such activities. Negative marketing through social media is easy, and such posts get viral at a faster speed than any other mean. Somehow such tactics are supported by some negative-minded audience, and a debate between moral and immoral activities is stated, and the huge audience participates in giving their views.</p>
<p>However negative marketing through social media is a big risk because sometimes the mess ends up with a mammoth loss like the one recently happened with Snap Chat for misusing Rihanna and Clark’s personal issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Support of Positivity</h2>
<p>On the other hand, 2018 trends also include support of positive campaign and initiatives by different organizations or people. Social media marketing gave a boost to campaigns that are thought-provoking. Even very small issues or cultural practices are being supported in the name of marketing of brands and products. The companies link their product to something indirectly to promote the cause and their brand, both at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sensitive Issues</h2>
<p>Many branding strategies include debates and discussions related to sensitive issues of the society. For example, there are several brands who took the initiative to feature fat, short-height, disable, syndrome patients as their models for promotion of their fashion products. They started such trends by posting some modeling pictures on social media and getting a view from the audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Promotion of Local Art and Culture</h2>
