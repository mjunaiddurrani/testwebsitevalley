<h2><strong>Study the industry</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing that you need to keep in mind is that ‘Less is more’. What do you mean by that? We’ll tell you right away. Let’s say you work at a shoe company with business cards that are minimal and sleek. You on the other hand want to do something fancy. That’s great, but will your audience be able to absorb that impact? Well, that really is the question. Usually stationery of the same industry work around the same by lines. It’s good to work with something unique but if it doesn’t woo your audience, it isn’t worth it.</p>
<h2><strong>Follow your design guideline</strong></h2>
<p>Never ever leave your design guideline when creating a stationery design. A stationery design is undoubtedly one of the most essential parts of your brand collateral. What you need to realize is that if you deviate from your base design at this point, it will leave you in a brand damaging problem. Always create a stationery design that sticks with your brand’s base design.</p>
<p>All in all, stationery designs are very important and there are several things that you need to be focusing on when creating stationery designs. Designing stationery? Need assistance? The Web Founders is here to help. Reach us today and discuss your project with us.</p>
