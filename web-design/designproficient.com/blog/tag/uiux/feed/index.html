				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graphic designing is a worthy skill that can make you earn in millions if only you know how to sell your art in the right manner. It is also true that for a valuable skill you should charge an amount that does justice with your efforts. As a graphic designer, there are many factors that shall lead you towards making a living through your work. A talented, well skilled designer usually know the game and they are pretty good in getting good clients on board and making an impressive portfolio to sell their talent in the market. However, as a new designer in market, it might be a challenge to sell your skills as new entrants are not much familiar with the tariff and rates.</p>
<p>Here are few things that will allow you to predict bidding rates as a new graphic designer in the market!</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/07/19/importance-unique-content-custom-website/">The Importance of Unique Content for Your Custom Website</a></p>
<h1><strong>Check the market rates</strong></h1>
<p>Check out the freelancing websites such as Fiverr and Upwork and go through the rates quoted by new entrants and professionals both on their gigs. Do a contrast of the average rates by them and predict a suitable price that you shall quote to your very first client.</p>
<h2><strong>Project Rates vs. Hourly rates</strong></h2>
<p>There is a different pricing schedule for projects and if you work for someone on hourly basis. All you have to be careful about is what goes out of your wallet before deciding your charges. As a freelancer or home based designer, you have to sensibly evaluate your overheads which includes the electricity and internet. If you are based in an office, your cost breakup shall also include your office expenses. If you use any subscription based resources such as Shutterstock, its subscription break-up shall also make its place in your invoice.</p>
<h2><strong>Apps and Software Cost</strong></h2>
<p>Apps and Software are paid and as a designer you should recover the payment through your work especially if your client is not tech savvy and doesn’t know much about technology and its cost. Photoshop costs £20 a month while Adobe CC kit costs around £45 a month. If you are using one of the apps from Adobe kit, each might cost you somewhere around £20. There even are paid invoice generating software which you might need to use.</p>
<h2><strong>Taxation and Licensing </strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>If you work in an office or even as a freelancer in a country where your income is taxed then you must include the taxation in the invoice to get your expense recovered. Licensing of your work is based on the media in which your artwork will be used by the client. For example if you are designing a billboard or a print ad, it is going to be charged high than a flyer, brochure, visiting card or a social media creative. Similarly, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">website designing</a> also has a different schedule of cost.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Users Only See What You Want Them to See</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is in your hand to make your users perceive whatever you want them to. No matter what you want, you can do so by making no hitches if you go wisely throughout the journey. Before incorporating things on your professional website, try to comprehend your customers’ outlooks. What your customers want should be more important to you. Showcase your ideas and product/services in such an appealing way that no one can ever even try to refuse your offerings.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Users Don’t Complain</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this era where every person has some jobs to do, people find it difficult to take their precious time to do any additional work. In this way, you have no room to give any benefit to your competitors by bothering people coming on your professional website. If users find any difficulty or confusion, they will make no time in abandoning your website without complaining. So, make your site the best place for users.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Users Do Not Struggle</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People landing on your site do not want to struggle in any way – whether it is your navigation system or anything else, should be built properly to avoid any hassle. Offer your users compelling and relevant Call to actions and guide them through every step so that they will not get confused and move further on your site.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Users Rely On Familiar Patterns</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offering your site visitors the familiar pattern is the best thing you can do for them. By familiar pattern, I meant your site should be recognizable and not looks alien to the visitors. Create your website while keeping the familiar pattern in your mind. The interface should be easy-to-use and comprehendible not only by the specific audience but for all.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Users Are Impatient</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case-study conducted recently suggested, people coming to your website are not that patient most of the website owners or designers do think them. What your users are impatient about? Your users are impatient about your website speed, and they do not take it jokily. The least time expectation of your website load should be no longer than 2 seconds. Low-speed websites are not only considered as a UX sin but also can be penalized by the search engine. So, make your site faster by eliminating all unnecessary elements, bulky images or videos, and also heavy widgets.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Users Expect a Lot</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking good care of your people to whom you have designed a website or to whom you are running a business is essential. Being a website owner to whom <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">UX is really important to know one thing that your users have some expectation</a> from you and you have an obligation to fulfill them as soon as possible without making any blunder. For the respective purpose, know what your users can expect to your site and try to fulfill them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Users Hate Interruptions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By any means, do not make your users angry by adding so many things that may interrupt them. Always keep your users ease and preferences in front of your mind. Eliminate or lessen down those pop-ups; subscription offers and make your users do what they want to do on a website.</p>
<p>Follow these secret tips, incorporate them into your website and outshine in this field.</p>

</ul>
<p>This year and even earlier, thick fonts and flexible typefaces are in the trend which is going to outshine even in the future.

</ul>

It is a year of bright, optimistic, lively and dynamic colors. Know about the psychology works behind each color. Not every color is suitable for your website design or customers. Some colors are provocative, some are soothing, and some are alienating. Research thoroughly and choose the best one.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>What is micro-interaction? It is a little animation or less visual responses users see when they are going to perform any particular action. Trigger, Rules, Feedback, and Loops &amp; Modes are the essential elements of micro-interaction. Micro-interactions can guide people how to use the interface, helps you know on which device users are in, enhance the UX, and have an overall psychological impact on users. A good micro-interaction stand-up in the overall design of the website interface and keep users engaged without distracting them at any point.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Content Strategy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Videos content strategy is a king among other <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">marketing strategies that help your website to rank better in a search engine results</a>. Adding compelling videos to a site make your website powerful enough to grab more customers. No doubt, videos can improve SEO, use for stronger consumer attention, the key to high engagement, and the most powerful way to evoke emotions of your customers online. In recent several years, videos have gained significant popularity, and 2018 will see more of video-based content coming up with live video options to convey information and feelings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporating Animation to the Website</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is your website static? Is your site boring without any animation? If, yes, then this trend is worth to look and follow. Incorporating attractive and <a href="https://www.commonplaces.com/blog/4-top-web-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2018">responsive animation can make your site more eye-grabbing and engaging</a>. From small waterproof effects to stunning video backdrops, you can do many things and take your site to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>LAST THOUGHT</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us spend more than two hours online every day using different devices with screens that require near exclusive attention where more than trillion websites and the same quantity of mobile apps are battling for our valuable time and attention. To make sure you achieve maximum attention of people in your website or app, The Web Founders has selected some crucial tactics or advices to make you stand out from the rest with your exceptional interface.</p>
<p>So, let’s drive&#8230;</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/24/change-brand-web-based-social-media-image-utilizing-design/">HOW TO CHANGE YOUR BRAND WEB-BASED SOCIAL MEDIA IMAGE UTILIZING DESIGN?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>1.    BE CAREFUL WITH NEW UI PATTERNS</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/design/10-quick-tips-for-uiux-design/">Do not make your audience to think too hard about the interface elements</a>. Most of the elements are already known to users. By this I meant, CTA should look like CTA, Links should look like links and so on.</p>
<p>There is no need to get too creative with common patterns or designs. It might sound exciting to do something out of the box or unique with them, but that does not mean usable. Usability and creativity need to be well-adjusted.</p>
<h1>2.    BE CAREFUL ABOUT SIMPLICITY</h1>
<p>It takes no longer than five seconds for users to judge your website, or whether they’re interested or not, so just be careful about what you want users to do on your site. Consider things that help you to make it easy to use. For the respective purpose, prefer consistent design, it is more straightforward or familiar for visitors because it reprocesses constituents, shades, and aesthetic to lessen the requirement for visitors to rethink.</p>
<h1>3.    BE DIRECT AND STAY HONEST</h1>
<p>By staying honest with yourself and visitors, you can convey your message with confidence. Honesty with a user works more than your thinking. So, for this purpose consider social proof instead of just talking about potentials. Nothing will upsurge your conversion as utterly as being honest with the customers.</p>
<h1>4.    COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CUSTOMERS</h1>
<p>Knowing who your users are, is crucial to make the interface most comfortable for them. For this, you have to select the audience relevant to your business. For example, if your website is about stylish chic outfits for women, choose women who want to wear such modern clothes. After targeting the audience, research on them to know their preferences and desires.</p>
<h1>5.    THINK HOW USERS WILL USE YOUR INTERFACE</h1>
<p>Before designing interface, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">you need to see how visitors will use your website or interface.</a> People landing on your site use it in two ways:</p>
<p>Directly: interacting with the elements of the product.</p>
<p>Indirectly: interacting with an element external to the product.</p>
<h2>Instances of direct interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Taking a card</li>
<li>Tapping a button</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping an item with a fingertip</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instances of indirect interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using key commands and shortcuts</li>
<li>Indicating and clicking with a mouse</li>
<li>Drawing on a Wacom tablet</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>6.    SET EXPECTATIONS</h1>
<p>Most of the interactions – directly or indirectly – have some consequences and sometimes, also anxiety. But, you can eliminate this anxiety of users by allowing your users know what will happen just after clicking that particular button before they do it. You can do this through thoughtful design. Highlight the CTA button with appropriate color that has strong meaning. Like we all know green is for a ‘go’ and red for ‘stop.’ You can also use widely understood symbols in a blend with the copy.</p>
<h1>7.    GIVE RESPONSE—FAST</h1>
<p>We are living in a world where environment gives us feedback or respond to our every action. Do you remember to know the stimulus and response theory? The theory implicates here &#8212; We speak, and others respond, or they speak, we respond.</p>
<p>When it comes to your website make sure it all happens quick. Any delay over 2-second mark as an interruption and more than that is enough to cause a bounce. So make your site fast and remove all unnecessary barriers for your users.</p>
<h1>8.    RECOGNITION TO RECALL</h1>
<p>This principle is psychological, suggests, if you have many choices, it is not that hard for you to recognize something already known. Recognition principle should be used wisely to make an experience more comfortable for users. The challenge with recognition is to give users familiar elements which they have been exposed to earlier, instead of expecting them to have a creative idea.</p>
<h1>END OF THE LINE</h1>
<p>So, these are some of tips we have gathered from different sources and experts. Hopefully, they will work for your website..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things like: death, taxes, and a question from people asking ‘So what do you do for a living’ are constant. But some things are not. Like, to give a suitable answer about how it should be a UX designer can be muddling even for many custom product designers.</p>
<p>I have seen so many people dealing with lots of problems in nailing down the answer of how to be a UX designer?</p>
<p>This is what I got from an expert:</p>
<p>“To be a UX designer, it is just like to be inside your users’ brain, to perceive design from the user’s perspective and to resolve expected confusions of users.”</p>
<p>It is like a never-ending route that requires keeping user experience prior more than anything. Though it is challenging to feel like a user, it is not impossible.</p>
<p>To guide your product design and make it bloom, I’ve collected several essential UX principles:</p>

<h1>Product Design Should Be Digestible:</h1>
<p>It would be easy to absorb or digest the product if it is simple and fulfils all the demands of users. You don’t need to spend lots of time or energy to see what things work. Consider all the things that help your product to make it the bottom of the funnel and opt the best one.</p>
<p>Design should be readable and easy to use to make users decide what to do. Users need proper guidelines, and you can do so by maintaining hierarchy and consistency in typography.</p>
<h1>Should Have Clarity:</h1>
<p>Beside things mentioned above, clarity is another thing that adds value to your product. One has to be very clear about his/her product.</p>
<p>With clarity in design, I mean to be very clear about product’s pricing. If users find any difficulty in figuring the price of a product, they’ll probably not buy that product. Therefore, it is important to mention price with ‘buy now’ ticker for better UX.</p>
<p>Making things as clear as possible should be your goal.</p>
<h1>Should Build Trust:</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">It is easy to trust if the design is good.</a> With honesty and clarity in explaining product’s features, one can build trust and increase conversions.</p>
<p>Consider Uber and its stress-free ride service. It is highly successful brand and a perfect example of building trust with consumers.</p>
<h1>Should Possess Familiarity:</h1>
<p>It is good if your product design is ground-breaking, but it should convert better. <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/10-ux-design-predictions-for-2018/">Offering entirely new framework and layout can be a UX killer.</a></p>
<p>Consider all the famous frameworks and layouts. Pay careful attention to each detail and use familiar patterns in your product to give it a native look.</p>
<h1>Should Be User-centric</h1>
<p>Being a product designer, you should have to build a thoughtful product with clear insight and intentions. The respective behavior towards product shows that you care about your users. It is also important as more than 60% of users give up your product just because they think you don’t care about them.</p>
<h1>WRAPPING IT UP</h1>
<p>It is quite easy to make the product as according to the UX canons. All you have to do is be very honest with yourself and perform each action from users’ perspective.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web designer must not forget that they have 10 seconds or even less to grab the visitors’ attention on the site. That means they have no chance to make any mistakes while making web designs.</p>
<p>The nonfunctional website is a big headache which is an outcome of our own mistakes. One can deal with it by ignoring the below-mentioned blunders while creating a web design:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong> Making Your Site Overloaded</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Heavy content or adding unnecessary things like excessive pop-ups, advertisements, plug-ins, and visuals can give your site a messy look. In fact, these things would be damaging for your site. Try to do performance/stress testing of your existing site and check if it’s free from load.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong> Not Mobile-Friendly</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to the perfect site, it is not an easy task. It should be both &#8212; desktop and mobile friendly. Unfortunately, most of the designers do not know that more than 40% of sales happen on mobile. And if people cannot approach your site via mobile than it’ll lose a big chance of traffic, ROI or sales. So check out if your site is handy for mobile or tablet users by testing it on suitable mobile-responsive checker tool.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong> Using Inappropriate Typography</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The use of inappropriate typefaces or unreadable fonts (use of too large or too small fonts) on the website is the not-to-do thing that we commonly do.</p>
<p>It is your task to offer people a website which has readable content. Use appropriate font size. Use bright colors against the light background and light colors against dark colored-background.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong> Avoid Simplicity </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Making things overcomplicated on site is another mistake most of us do, that should be sidestepped. With simple layouts, illustration, and the familiar language you can make things easy-to-understand and simple for your customers.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2><strong> Poor Navigating System</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The site built with the strong navigating system is considered as successful. On the other hand, if people find difficulty in searching or getting their required information, they will abandon the site.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.netguru.co/blog/10-ux-tips-to-improve-website-navigation">Creating a navigating system on your site is not enough</a>. Rather one has to maintain its performance. Poorly built navigation bar can make things horrible for your visitors and so for you.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2><strong> Adding Excessive Backlinks</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Adding Backlinks is useful but too many links on your webpage is against strong <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">UI/UX design</a> canon. Excessive backlinks can distract readers to engage with your website. Unfortunately, I’ve seen many people doing this. I would suggest not to add more than two backlinks in a single web page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h2><strong> Ignore Headings- H1 and H2</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the designers ignore the importance of headings and emphasis more on the content; it is UX killer. Remember more than 80% of visitors read the headings of your site and judge content. Aappealing headlines can give you a better chance of higher viewership. The site should possess clear, indulging headings and subheadings through which website can rank.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h2><strong> Having No or Unclear Key Information </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Who are you? What services you’re offering? How you deliver them? How people can contact you?  These are some of the things your visitors may want to know immediately after landing on your website. Unfortunately, most of us missed these things to mention clearly in sites and got poor outcomes in the face of low traffic or sales.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h2><strong> Putting Irrelevant or Less Interactive Visuals</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Images and videos could be more interactive than those wordy texts written on your site if they&#8217;re being used wisely. Most of us, sometimes, emphasizing more on the text do not give importance to the relevancy of the visuals. Remember poor selection of visuals can ruin the overall website design.</p>
<p>So, these are the common but serious mistakes we often use to do while designing. Hopefully you have found these things helpful enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding a designer to work on a specific project seems significantly easy these days. If you know your basics around photoshop and illustrator, chances are you’ll get tons of clients without a problem. However, if you don’t know the essentials to a specific design type, chances are your designs won’t really work for your client. Web UI belongs to a similar class.</p>
<h1><strong>Understanding Web UI</strong></h1>
<p>The user interface for Web Design isn’t as simple as designer a header, a footer, a few sliders and folds in between. The trajectory of Web UI differs from brand to brand. Consider Web UI similar to an ideology.  Your design portrays what your company stands for and that’s why your focus needs to be immense. As a graphic designer, you need to put your heart and soul into designing a web UI that’s near perfection for the brand you’re working on. In this blog, we’ll be assisting you in creating the best Web UI that you can possibly find.</p>

<h2><strong>Focus on the blend between Web UI and UX</strong></h2>
<p>One thing that you need to understand is that good UX is directly proportional to good UI. That’s literally the one statement that can drift you towards success in no time. The user interface needs to go hand in hand with the user experience. From the click of a button to the complete scrolling order on the website, user experience accounts to everything.</p>
<h2><strong>Understand Your Target Market</strong></h2>
<p>Your target market is the industry that you’re targeting to achieve ROI. While some might feel that the target market is important solely for marketing purposes, they’re mistaken. Consider how your targeted audience would react to the design you’ve made. A minimalistic design full of aesthetics might be great for a targeted audience of youngsters and teenagers that are creative; but hey, maybe not for an audience of a mean age between 30 to 40. So, what good is an aesthetic design when your audience doesn’t understand it? Exactly the point.</p>
<h2><strong>Design Consistency Is Key</strong></h2>
<p>Design is nothing but concept and concepts don’t change halfway into the design. This is exactly why Web UI consistency is important as well. From the color tone to the aesthetics being used. Every element being used in the design is essential to the concept one of the many reasons why you need to keep it consistent throughout the design.</p>
<p>All in all, Web UI is important for an ROI that your business targets. At The Web Founders, we take care of Web UI very carefully. Want our experienced web design and development professionals to work on your project? Reach us today and discuss your project.</p>
