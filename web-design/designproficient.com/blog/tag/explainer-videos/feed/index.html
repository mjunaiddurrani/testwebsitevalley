				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Explainer videos have boomed in popularity over the past year due to their affordability and proven effectiveness in growing a business. This makes explainer videos for business an excellent marketing tool. Increasing your conversion rates with an affordable explainer video, clarifying your product, and boosting your sales are just 3 of the 5 reasons why your business should have an animated video for business.</p>
<h2><strong>INCREASING CONVERSION RATES</strong></h2>
<p>According to a recent survey conducted by <a href="https://www.videobrewery.com/blog/10-reasons-why-your-business-needs-an-explainer-video/">Video Rascal</a>, 85 percent of people are more likely to buy a product once they see an accompanying explainer video. Business explainer videos help budding business owners keep tally of how many visitors on their sites could become actual customers. Although most businesses manually count sales to see what products are most popular, explainer videos keep track of what product or service potential customers are interested by displaying the number of views on each video.</p>
<h2><strong>CLARIFYING YOUR PRODUCT</strong></h2>
<p>Text can be tricky since there are so many ways people can interpret what they read. Explainer videos take the guess work out of explaining the usefulness and basic function of a product or service. People gain a better understanding of a product or service once they see and hear someone explain it. An explainer video helps you to connect better with your potential customer by explaining what your business can do for them and why they should choose you over other competing businesses</p>

<h2><strong>GENERATING INCREASED INTEREST</strong></h2>
<p>More and more businesses are choosing to use social signals to spread the word about their businesses. They do this by using media such as images and videos to generate interest in their product. According to a study published in The C100, over 70 percent of Internet users watch videos online, and over 50 percent of the population will watch videos this year!</p>
<h2><strong>RANK BETTER IN GOOGLE SEARCH</strong></h2>
<p>Statistically speaking, stale websites don’t do well. Websites that contain endless pages of block text and images rank low in Google search, which means less exposure. This also scares away customers who want to quickly understand a product, and purchase it right then and there. In most cases, the average person takes less than a minute to make a purchasing decision. An explainer video will get their attention immediately.</p>
<h2><strong>INCREASE WEB TRAFFIC</strong></h2>
<p>Going “viral” is a term that has been around since the dawn of YouTube. A viral video is one that seemingly pops-up out of nowhere and gets a large viewing in a short amount of time. Unfortunately, there is no set formula for “going viral”, but quite a few products have gained popularity through viral videos, including some of the brands we know and love today.</p>
<p>Aside from boosting sales, gaining popularity for your brand, and explaining your product successfully, there are so many more benefits to using an explainer video that we would need an explainer video to list them all. People all over the world create videos about everything from cause awareness to reviews, proving that videos are the most popular medium for people to share information and advertise.</p>
