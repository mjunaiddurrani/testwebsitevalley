				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All businesses today strive to increase the profit margin in order to smoothly manage and run their operations, expand services and offer a comparative advantage to the customers. However, this is easier said than done, especially in today’s modern and fast paced world where competition is tough.</p>
<p>Successfully aligning both the sales and marketing teams within a company is a practice which is as old as the entire corporate structure itself. For numerous companies, the marketing department’s job is to generate successful leads and the sale’s team’s job to turn them into loyal customers.</p>
<p>According to theory, it is important that both the marketing alongside the sales teams, work in tandem, to align shared goals as well as roles to ensure ROI becomes the responsibility or the organization, rather than that of individual teams.</p>
<p>Unluckily, building a solid team around marketing and sales alignment is usually easier said than done. Nevertheless, here are 5 brilliant ideas using which you can effectively implement an amazing strategy and make sure everyone keeps and works towards common goals and targets.</p>

<h1>Determine the Company’s Marketing Goals</h1>
<p>Even though this might sound a little cliché, but it is advised that you “Plan your work, and work your plan.” Developing a strategic plan is going to help your organization go a long way towards getting off to a very good start. When you are determining the marketing goals, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What new products and/or services will I be launching this year?</li>
<li>What is the overall revenue goal for this year?</li>
<li>What key metrics are extremely important when it comes to measuring my sales and marketing success?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Reduce Your Expenses</h1>
<p>One of the tried and tested ways using which you can bring up your sales is by reducing your expenses. For examples, you may want to consider having shared offices instead of having your own expansive and expensive space. Keep a track of your account books and identify where your money is going. After analyzing this, look for various different ways to reduce all the expenses incurred without actually compromising the business.</p>
<h1>Improve Your Customer Relationship</h1>
<p>You should also be active when it comes to improving your relationship with your clients. Focus on initiating loyalty. When consumers are loyal, you can trust that they will support your products, even when you increase prices, given that the quality remains top-notch. Research about your clients, think about customer segmentation, learn about what they need, and design approaches that will allow you to deliver a high level of consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is very easy to be overwhelmed when it comes to considering all the various different marketing choices and paths accessible to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">grow your business</a>. Nonetheless, with all signs pointing towards constant economic growth worldwide in the year 2018, there is still time to create a plan to increase revenue this year.</p>

<p><strong>Make use of correct CTAs (Call to action)</strong> – <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/scannable-content/">SEO content must have a few lines that can drive the reader for an action</a>. You can do this by using words like “click, share or comment” at the end of your SEO blog or article.</p>
<p><strong>Address the reader</strong> – The sign of a good content is where the addressee is defined. The reader should be addressed directly throughout the content. This makes your content more engaging and optimizes its readability.</p>
<p><strong>Use of keywords</strong> – A well written content is the one which is backed by intelligent keyword research. A writer should know how to incorporate the picked keywords in their articles and follow the ratio in the content accordingly.</p>

<h1>1st tip# Create great content</h1>
<p>If you want to rank high in the search engine, then a high content can help you the most. Websites with a fresh, genuine and relevant content are more likely to get a chance to rank. Avoid grammatical mistakes and spelling lower. The question, how long the content should be? must be popping in your mind. Well, there’s no exact answer to it, but it should be at least not smaller than 500 words. In fact, for many, it is good minimum length for a typical blog post.</p>
<p>If we go with research, then it has shown that posts longer than 1000 words tend to rank better. Search engine likes authoritative posts with more than 2000 words. It means, if you want to improve your ranking chances in the future with in-depth articles or blogs, you have to focus on both quality and quantity. The content must be excellent in quality, should be more than 2000 words. So, try to make your writings fun to read, avoid being too much promotional, don’t be boring and assure your content should not look like a legal document. As an alternative, opt for friendly, amusing content.</p>
<h2>2nd tip# Build backlinks to your website</h2>

This would be beneficial to your audience, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">will help improve your website’s SEO</a>, make it comfortable for readers to find something useful from your site.</p>
<h2>3rd tip# Optimized URLs</h2>

<h2>4th tip# Page titles</h2>
<p>Your website’s page must possess compelling and relevant title with some keywords. The title should be descriptive enough to grasp by the readers about the content. For instance, if your blog is about “Effective Logo Designing,” then a great title should be “Effective Logo Designing in ten easy tips” or “<a href="https://www.designhill.com/design-blog/simple-logo-design-recognition/">How to create an effective logo for your business</a>.” However, make sure that your page title should not longer than 70 characters. Although Google will index lengthier page titles, they will be shortened in the search results.</p>
<h2>5th tip# Header tags</h2>
<p>It would be perfect to incorporate the keyword phrase in a header tag, but make sure you’re not spoiling it. The ideal way to include a keyword phrase in a header tag is to use the first heading on the web page as the search engine will pay more attention to H1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6th tip# Make your Professional Web page load faster</h2>
<p>For search engine how much time your website takes in load matters a lot. In fact, it is ranking factor for Google. New case study sheds light that when search engine added website speed into the Algorithm, sites that took more than five minutes to load had to face a severe drop in traffic from search engine.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike paid traffic, <a href="https://www.smartbugmedia.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-direct-and-organic-search-traffic-sources">organic traffic refers to non-paid traffic</a>. It includes traffic from search engines, social media sites, referral traffic, and direct traffic. These are the traffic achieved organically, rather than any source of paid promotion or advertising.</p>
<p>Publishing the relevant and high-quality content on blog and website is one way to boost the organic traffic of your site. This is, in fact, most comfortable and functional technique used for obtaining new visitors on the website. SEO &#8211; search engine optimization is the outlet of online marketing that emphases directly on cultivating and boosting organic traffic.</p>
<p>Now, let’s suppose that Google is starting to choke organic traffic and limiting the visitors that can get to a site after searching. What would happen, then?</p>
<p>It’s not daydreaming. It&#8217;s happening now. Doubting how? Here’s how.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/08/brand-something-logo/">Why Your Brand Is Something Other Than Your Logo</a></p>
<h1>The Knowledge Graph</h1>
<p>Since the establishment, The Knowledge Graph has been getting more popularity. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Google is using the Knowledge Graph to enhance its search engine’s services</a> with information collected from a variety of sources. Moreover, this refers to Google’s central database of information on movies, historical events, locations, and other topics; when a user searches any topic, a box on the right-side of the search engine results page will display relevant information to that topic along with links to Google pages for other related topics.</p>
<p>Now, it can be a long debate with a lot of confusions about whether The Knowledge Graph really steals organic traffic or not. No matter what, it is clear that anyone looking for his needed information in these boxes doesn’t require to click a link for any more information.</p>
<h1>Carousels</h1>
<p>What is Carousel? How it links with Google? To make sure a perfect web experience delivers to all its users. Google offers Carousel, the most valuable improvement which takes local search to the next level. Google carousels help people with information. It is quite similar to the concept of Knowledge Graph. Both tend to help users. For instance, if anyone searches for ‘Rampage,’ He’ll come up with individual entries for Dwayne Johnson, Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman, Jake Lacy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and some other stuff related to his search. Now, every single entry links to another page with more specific information on each cast. Let’s say, the biography, the career, the rewards and the list is endless. Principally, it’s another doorway that makes the Knowledge Graph more influential – while making it less likely, users need to visit external websites to find the information they’re eyeing for.</p>
<h1>Videos and Content</h1>
<p>Search engines like GOOGLE, YAHOO, and BING offer text-based and visual content which people is searching for. Especially Google assures with its videos and content offerings to fulfill people search requirements. By guaranteeing this, Google makes its ownership of YouTube treasured. Users also get engage with content without going on to any other web page.</p>
<p>These are only three things I’ve mentioned; there’re many other things which screaming loudly that Google is taking a step to keep users on Google for an extended period (as long as possible) by offering them required answers on their queries.</p>
<p>Somehow, it is the critical or tensing situation, but that doesn’t apply that one should have to lessen down his investment in search engine optimization. Don’t worry, Google cannot provide everything to its users.</p>
