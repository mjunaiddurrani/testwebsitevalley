				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An on-point strategy, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">unique design</a>, and flawless development are the key ingredients to build a promising mobile app. However, application analytics is the ultimate tool that evaluates how well the app design and strategy has been executed and how it is performing in the market.</p>
<p>Here are 6 analytics strategies that you can use to measure the performance of your mobile app.</p>

<h1>1.    Start using App Analytics during app development</h1>
<p>Analytics should start right from the start, even before your app is ready for the launch. From ideation to design and development, there are a lot of steps involved, each with its own specific data that can be analyzed for your own benefit. App analysis right from the beginning of app development process will allow you to test, assess and troubleshoot issues and ensure that the first version you release is free of any loops or discrepancies.</p>
<h2>2.    Identify the usage pattern</h2>
<p>You may have a clear idea about the usage of your app, but your users may not necessarily conform to it. After you have released your application in the market, there is no way you can make the users follow the usage pattern recommended by you. This is why it is essential for you to keep tabs on how different users are using your app and for what purpose. This will allow you to identify the modifications and upgrades you need to make in the coming versions.</p>
<h2>3.    Specify relevant KPIs</h2>
<p>All apps are not same and different apps are created to serve different purposes. Before you release your app in the market, make sure you have devised an analytics strategy based on <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-blogging-metrics-kpis-list">specific KPIs</a> relevant to the genre of your app.</p>
<h2>4.    Track Downloads</h2>
<p>The magnitude of downloads is one of the core parameters to evaluate the performance of an application. This is the reason why many businesses, companies and app developers are only focused on getting maximum downloads. While this certainly is important, you also need to identify the type of users downloading your app. This will help you analyze whether your app is attracting the right audience, in line with your projected strategy.</p>
<h2>5.    Ratings and Reviews</h2>
<p>Reviews, <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/07/use-reviews-and-testimonials-for-marketing.html">ratings and testimonials</a> play a key role in influencing customers’ decision. It is estimated that around 88% users look for rating and online reviews left by other users before downloading an app or software. Another fact is that a majority of the users who have downloaded an app and are satisfied with it do not leave any review – which means there’s a lot of potential you can garner by encouraging your users to rate your app and provide their reviews on your website and app stores.</p>
<h2>6.    Target versus Return Reporting</h2>
<p>Target versus returns analysis provides an insight into the profitability of your app, as in whether it is meeting the strategic targets and to what extent is it generating returns. However, the key to an on-point target versus returns analysis is to set realistic goals and tie them to a specific time frame so as to assess results and identify whether or not the app is performing up to par.</p>
