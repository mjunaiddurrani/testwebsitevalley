				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Created website by putting all efforts, without taking much care about website’s metrics, is just like walking down a dark cave and assuming someone will torch a light for you.</p>
<p>Metrics are numbers that state accurate measurement and provide a base to suggest enhancements. Considering one measurement is not enough to measure the effectiveness of your website. Both operational and financial metrics are commonly used to track and assess the status of a specific process.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.spinweb.net/steps-to-audit-your-website-and-present-your-findings">Most of the professional web designers find difficult to choose right metric.</a> For convenience, I’ve compiled some of the well-known metrics helpful for your website:</p>

<h1>1.    Number of Website Visitors</h1>
<p>It is crucial to possess reliable source to track incoming traffic on your custom website. For the respective purpose, there’re three primary sources or three type of website visitors. The one who enters directly into your site by typing URL in browser address. The one who enters your site based on the search request. The last ones are the referral visitors. All three sources have a different level of conversion, and you should calculate traffic of each.</p>
<h1>2.    Bounce Rate</h1>
<p>In internet marketing, bounce rate refers to the measurement of people entering your website without going to any other webpage. Simply put, it is just like a single-page session that generates only a single request to the analytics server. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Low bounce rate means that visitors’ engagement is good on your site.</a> On the contrary, high bounce rate is an indicator of a bad situation.</p>
<h1>3.    Exit Pages</h1>
<p>Most of the visitors often get confused between “bounce” and “exit.”  Both are different metrics to measure. Unlike a “bounce,” when a site visitors enter to your site and hardly views one page, an “exit” is when a user enters and visits a number of pages and then abandon your site. If your website has a high exit rate, it has some problem. Knowing the exit rates and reasons one can improve site traffic and so conversion.</p>
<h1>4.    Crawl Errors</h1>
<p>Besides the metrics mentioned above, Google Search Console displays you crawl errors. It is pointless to say that, any crawl error on the website should be addressed soon, having crawl errors on site is as just your website does not work as they are supposed to and doesn’t bring you any conversion. It is imperative to check crawl errors report once a week and deal with what you find. High crawl errors mean that your site is either down or misconfigured. Low crawl errors is a temporary condition and also indicate your improper site configuration.</p>
<h1>5.    Final Conversions</h1>
<p>To know how well your strategy is working you need to know about final conversions. It is a metric and very simple to achieve. It is an achievement of the end goal you set in front of your business. Final conversion is the only metric that allows you if you should change anything on your website.</p>
<p>Though there are numerous other subtle metrics, but metrics mentioned above, are enough to make or destroy your professional website.</p>
