<h1><u>Characters</u></h1>
<p>Use customized characters to demonstrate the stuff in your animated videos. Originally exclusive characters keep the curiosity factor alive hence, viewer watch the video till ending. Characters make the product and script of video interesting. Also, they play a role in crafting a creative impact regarding the brand.</p>
<h2><u>Background Illustrations</u></h2>

For a genuine appearance of your product, backgrounds are the energizing element. They enhance the look of the product, helps in creating a niche in viewer`s mind and promotes the desire for that product.</p>
<h2><u>Theme Base</u></h2>

The concept of following single theme is loved by the audience because it makes them understand the website navigation system and the concept of product easily. The theme also gives a great visual appeal. It is a safe play for designers because with very less effort they can create synchronization between several elements of design.</p>
<h2><u>Scripting</u></h2>
<p>Obviously, a <a href="https://www.videobrewery.com/blog/how-to-write-a-killer-explainer-video-script/">video is incomplete without a script</a>. A proper script is the backbone of animated videos. The conversational tone of the script is very catchy for the viewers. Tailor your script in a way that you or your character is directly talking to the viewers. Manage some words to define the background of your product/services/ business concept. This small alteration in your script can add life to your animated video.</p>
<h2><u>Minimalism</u></h2>
<p>Minimalism means adding only necessary elements and cut off from extra ornamentation in your designing or concept. The theory of minimalism allows video directors to add necessary point in less time frame. <a href="https://wistia.com/blog/optimal-video-length">Short videos are more ideal</a> and to keep them short yet productive minimalism idea is very suitable.

Today the ongoing trend is of customized website designing so design houses or individual designers cannot pay hours and hours to one project hence they minimalism provides them ease. The design is functional and easily operated that it is proficient for customers.</p>
<h2>Quick look, Quick Decision</h2>
<p>Previously people use to spend hours on the decorative and extra elements, at that time this approach was fascinating because there were limited websites active for any specific service or product but now the competition is tough and people have a lot of options when they search for anything. In such circumstances people open a website, give it a quick look, if they find it easy going or understandable they pay some time to it otherwise they quickly shift to other websites.</p>
<p>For such quick look, quick decision nature of consumers, it is ideal to present things in a way that they get the brand`s message at first glimpse.</p>
<h2>Highlight what is Important</h2>
<p>As the website has selective things it is easy for designers to bring out important things to the front. The simple tactics like changing the size of the font or adding bright colors to key points grab the attention of viewers quickly. Also, consumers find the specific website, easy to explore because they don’t have to dig out required information from a junk of content. Because it highlights what is most important it actually helps users to operate the website easily and somehow convince them to buy mentioned products or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those were some the reason why we think the minimal <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">design is the future of web UI/UX.</a> The most important point is that audience is loving such designs. For a brand as well as for a designer this is the most considerable point of adopting minimalism design approach in future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To become a better web designer is a never-ending struggle as there is no limit to the creative ways through which you can enhance the layout of the website. To create an online masterpiece, a designer has to explore the depth of technical possibilities, experiment unique ideas and take sheer risks.</p>
<p>The layout of the <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/graphic-designer-secrets/">website reflects the designer’s talen</a>t and efforts but hard work is not all you need to bring out the best results. For designing an attractive website, the designers should take notice of some tips and tricks through which they can amplify their efficiency. You need to go through these ingenious ideas to hone your web designing skills.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1>Pay Attention to Latest Techniques</h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Web designing industry is heavily driven by trends. You do not necessarily need to follow trends but to get to the top of all you need to at least pay attention to the latest designing techniques being used commercially. Be a competent critique, develop an eye for holding the best ideas and master the skills of executing them in the most unique and inspiring ways.</p>
<p>ALSO READ:<a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/01/09/video-marketing-future-heres-3-reasons/"> Is video marketing the future? Here‘s 3 reasons why!</a></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Avoid Thinking of Coding While Layout Designing</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our will to experiment unique techniques often wavers when we start thinking about coding even before planning the layout. Your first draft of design should be relentlessly creative and based entirely on imagination without technical concerns. Develop the mock-up in Photoshop first and then dig into coding it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2>Banner Slideshow Won’t Work</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The trend of slideshow/image carousel previously became very popular but it doesn’t seem to outshine anymore. This layout is although inclusive in terms of information but with escalating competition in the web market, the user hardly stays that long to go through all banners. Be more particular and well-defined. Decide one prominent feature of your product and present it in the most appealing style.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2>Use Simpler Navigation</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We have come a long way beyond all those traditional headers or sidebars flooded with links and tabs.<a href="http://brolik.com/blog/simplify-navigation-better-usability-2/"> Simplify the navigation</a> by reducing the links. Avoid using dropdown and multi-tier menus as they often overwhelm the users.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2>Slide Away Social Media Icons</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The important information about your product should take the most prominent place on your webpage, not the social media icons. Placing these icons on header would be an unwise thing to do as you will invite users to leave just before they fully arrive. Place the icons in the footer and let users connect with your product first and then move further to find out more.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2>The Lesser the Better</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Motion-Graphics">If you want to design elegant</a> and sophisticated website, master the skill of using the white-space efficiently. Just hone this one hack and you can do wonders with your website designs. Observe and pay attention to minimal websites and learn to give your website enough room to breathe.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h2>Make Font Size Bigger and Colors Bolder</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In web design, typography and colors are incredibly important as they draw most of the attention of the user. Make your font stand out and clearly visible by increasing its size. Take inspiration from the beauty of nature and extract vibrant and contrasting palette of colors for your web landscape.</p>
<p>Now you know the drill and technique to play with your creativity. Just go ahead and create wonders.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the article “Video Marketing: <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2017/10/future-content-seo-trends/">The Future of Content Marketing</a>” published in Forbes Magazine video consumption trend is increasing rapidly because videos are projected to claim more than 80% of all web traffic by 2019.</p>
<p>Videos over landing pages can actually help increase conversion rate by 80% and also an addition of a video to marketing emails boost up click-through rates by 200 to 300%. That is why marketers are already using video content to promoter brands and products. They also consider it as the power tool for future marketing plans. Here is three major reason.</p>
<h1><u>Video Marketing Delivers Clear Brand Message to the Audience</u></h1>
<p>Online videos are considered as a good way to create an image of any specific brand. Video delivers the brand message better than blogs. Another major benefit of video is that they explain functionality and usage of any product. A clear explanation of product actually helps users to evaluate whether they need that product or not.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/3-creative-ways-to-use-live-video-for-business/">video is a creative way</a> to deliver information even about the most boring thing. In minimum time a great count of information can be delivered without making viewers bore or fed up. Addition of illustrative characters, computer graphics and 3D modeling of products make the video interesting to watch. 70 percent of people prefer to watch a video about product, brand or service rather than reading a blog.</p>

<h2><u>Video Marketing Adds Value </u></h2>
<p>90% of customers consider that videos assist them to make purchasing decisions. Product videos provoke human mind to generate an ease of life by using the specified product. It can be said that videos sometimes generate a need for the product and help brand owners to sell their products to the people who had never tried or think of their product.</p>
<p>Videos cover a wide number of the audience so the probability is high that a video will hit the targeted audience. That`s why marketers consider videos as a major tool to beat competitors and invest good budget in producing brand videos. Video marketing adds value to the brand and also make customers to understand the place of brand or product in their life.</p>
<h2><u>Video Marketing Encourages Social Shares</u></h2>
<p>The trend of video sharing sometimes makes videos viral. Any viral product video is actually a hit set for the brand owners and a source to increase sells up to 80%. Online videos are a great way to have organic traffic over the social media page and eventually over the website. 90% people share videos on social media platforms or send videos through messengers without the intention of promoting any brand or product but the brand owners get the full benefit. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Motion-Graphics">That`s why it is suggested to create a creative video</a> and of a level that it can get viral or at least video have something for viewers for which they will share and spread the video.</p>
<p>Above mention, three reasons are genuine reasons that marketers present to the people to add video content to the marketing plan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all are familiar with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> and we know that along with fun many people are promoting their businesses and brands. Some of the brands are actually got popularity just because of Instagram among which <a href="http://www.shophudabeauty.com/?v=d71bdd22c8bb">Huda Beauty Products</a> by Huda Kattan (@hudabeauty) is an amazing example.</p>
<p>Photo sharing and making them hit on Instagram is usual but when it comes to videos things are not that simple. People quickly scroll down in microseconds if they don’t find the video according to their mood and interest.</p>
<p>If you compare it with<a href="https://www.facebook.com/"> Facebook video</a> liking formulas are entirely different for Instagram the reason is that on Facebook you have the margin of making video content popular through comment discussions and text box stories or material. On the Instagram platform, your strategies need tweaking because here you cannot initiate any discussion, the scrolling and skipping stuff is 30 times more often than Facebook and also people did not read long stories and text content much on Instagram.</p>
<p>To guide you, below are three tips that can make your video hit on Instagram especially when it is for promotion and marketing purposes.</p>

<h1><strong>Come to the Point</strong></h1>
<p>You have video option on Instagram but there is no rewind and forward option and you cannot skip some part of the video. So make sure that from the beginning until the end you are précised and to the point. Dragging the stuff will make you lose your audience.</p>
<p>For commercial video, if it is a video for any product, start sho0wing the functionality and benefits of the product in the beginning. Long intros are not effective. Within 15seconds you have to put an impact on the viewers and a fact is that videos having a duration of 10seconds or less are more popular on Instagram.</p>
<p>So it is ideal to make put all essential information in the beginning so that before scrolling down in the middle of your video people can get the information and chances are high that this technique will make them wait and look for the whole video.</p>
<h2><strong>Show You Presence</strong></h2>
<p>Showing what you want to deliver is not enough. It sounds rude, but the reality is that why anyone should care about your content. To make them look you videos, you need to show your presence.</p>
<p>Follow back your followers. Give some time to look what they have to show, watch there video and put likes, or comments frequently. That will make them and their followers know that you are around and putting some attention to their content as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/travis-wright/16-top-marketing-blogs-and-publications-you-need-to-be-following.html">As a brand or a marketer</a>, your presence and number of followers and people you are following is highly important. You can also follow other brands (not the competitors), usually, brand profiles have a huge number of followers so from there you can pick active, and interested people to follow and get followings in return.</p>
<h2><strong>Add Fun Element</strong></h2>
<p>Don’t make things bore, Instagram is not a platform for too much serious stuff. Mix fun elements in your videos. Add a song or god music in the background. If it is kind of a tutorial or shows how your product works, make it fun by adding some loud expressions, adding catchy dialogues, some dramatic effect or anything.</p>
<p>A blend of fun and brand promotion is 60times loved more on Instagram than just a normal brand promotional stuff.</p>
<p>So, for your upcoming Insta video keep these points in your mind and Insta-It with a style.</p>
