				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Originally derived by Google, material deign is a fusion of “material” elements, minimalistic classic design, micro interactions and customized user experiences all intricately fused together.

<p>With the flexibility to expand, contract, layer and stack on a wide range of screen sizes without effecting the flow of animations and typographical elements. Material design has become a great way to ensure a future proof contributor to the ever growing web. It basically allows web content to flow in synchronization with various screen sizes that offers the user experience to be without any glitches. Following is a list of components used in material design:</p>
<h2><strong>Comprehensive Visual Cues.</strong></h2>
<p>Material design operates with a number of visual cues, a great example of this is the dog eared page corner which signifies that you can turn, or rotate the current page or text.</p>
<h2><strong>Extremely Flexible.</strong></h2>
<p>Being built within the space of tactile reality, material design can transform into multiple shapes and grow or shrink within its plane. However it cannot exist where there is already another material exists.</p>
<h2><strong>Being highly interactive.  </strong></h2>
<p>Material design allows users to move, manipulate, re-order, and reveal content with ease. Having multiple layers and elements within one space, the design works seamlessly allowing users to see what’s available and helps to narrow down their search requirements.</p>
<h2><strong>Filled with Bold Graphics.</strong></h2>
<p>Bold graphics offer a direct sense of purpose without any kind of misinterpretation. Being flexible with bold graphics allows users to comfortably work with high quality elements across different screen resolutions, platforms and devices.</p>
<h2><strong>Smooth Navigation.</strong></h2>
<p>Material design can be manipulated in a way which can allow users to have full navigation control and the way the content is displayed.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly a breakthrough in the way we experience the World Wide Web, material design has made the online experiences seem like a walk in the park which definitely makes the value of material design timeless. It is fair to say that the use of material design will be seen across the internet in the years to come.</p>
<p>Web developers and designers all acknowledge the true value and impact material design has on all websites. After all said and done, the true importance of material can only be experienced firsthand and when we talk about material design being future proof, the crucial significance that material design has on a website speaks for itself.</p>
