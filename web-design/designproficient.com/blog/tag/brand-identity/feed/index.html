				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American billionaire businessman, Scott Cook says, “A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is – it is what consumers tell each other it is.” This valuable quote alone speaks so much about the significance of a brand and its effect beyond our thoughts. Branding depicts the entire personality, equity and image of the company. From logo design to campaign copy everything has a significant contribution in the company’s ideology, philosophy and core purpose of its message can be understood with the right kind of branding.</p>

<p>Branding is the most powerful aspect of your company therefore you should be very careful about what it looks like and what things it shall reflect to your target market. Sometimes there are minor loopholes in your branding strategy that fail the brand and ultimately cause you to revamp the entire image of your brand all over again. Rebranding your company is a tricky decision that may also be pretty costly and companies who consider about rebranding should keep certain things in mind.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips that will help your business with the decision of rebranding taken righteously!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong>Figure out the need</strong></h1>
<p>– Determining the reason for rebranding is very important. The reason could be just anything but defined. It can be anything that covers a negative reputation that your company might have underwent or your customers simply don’t respond you the way you wanted them to. As the reasons are explored, they help you with a proper plan of rebranding.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Create a Plan</strong></h2>
<p>– For all kinds of decisions in any business, a proper roadmap is highly necessary. Once you have noted down the core points that trigger your mind towards getting a revamp on your company’s brand, you must create a plan of how to start doing it. Rebranding can possibly be started as simply as just changing the color of your company’s logo or twisting its design a bit.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Revamp the Logo </strong></h2>
<p>– <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Redesigning the logo will be the most evident step while rebranding as the logo is the prime identity of any company</a>. It would be good to start with it!</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Modify Packaging</strong></h2>
<p>– If you are a company that sells certain kind of products then changing the package designs could also be an important tip. It is believed that the last and closest campaign that a company runs to reach out their customer is the product packaging so this can possibly be an important tool.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Twist your Ad Campaigns </strong></h2>
<p>– If your brand or company has been using a certain kind of content since forever, then maybe this is the right time to twist that a bit to give a revamped message to your audience.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Do some Customer Research</strong></h2>
<p>– Knowing your customers is good but learning what they need is very important. If you know what are the likes and dislikes of your customers, it becomes easier for you to recreate an image that matches well with their taste. Social Media is a helpful tool that can get you an appropriate response.</li>

<li>
<h2><strong>Compare your Brand</strong></h2>
<p>– A sensible comparison between you and your competitors done beforehand can result in a proactive attempt for rebranding. You can learn from the achievements and mistakes made by them.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days when a logo was considered everything to the business or brand. It is not. A custom logo does not represent your philosophy, your societies, or your story, does not legitimize your business, and it is not your brand. Then, what is the brand?</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/07/5-writing-prescription-web/">5 Writing Prescription for the Web</a></p>
<h1>The Brand Is Your People.</h1>
<p>Your people are a better contender for your brand and also the way they behave. This means, your brand is as valuable as your people. Let’s take a look at some of the big global household brands like GSK, P&amp;G or Unilever; you know them primarily through their consumers. These brands are being used by 2 billion people every day.</p>
<h2>The Brand Is Your Value.</h2>
<p><a href="https://99designs.com/blog/tips/types-of-logos/">Your brand is more than that colorful little image which we all call Logo or a custom logo</a>. Instead, your brand is guarantees and values you offer to the people. It should be promising and valuable. It is a relationship—a strong one with your customers. It trusts you build. It is an inspiration, and the list is endless.</p>
<h2>The Brand Is The Way You Speak.</h2>
<p>Your brand is your voice. The more strong voice, the more strong your brand. In this way, using old copy is a quick way to end-up with ordinary or worst consequences. If you are letting acronyms, social service jargon, and complex concepts contaminate everything you say, that’s your brand. If it’s trying to be all things to all people, that’s your brand. In other words, your action is your brand. Your voice is your brand. Whatever you do or doing is your brand.</p>
<h2>The Brand is Facilities you provide.</h2>
<p>In a competitive market, product uniqueness is no longer adequate to retain credible competitive benefits. Today, business has to position the overall corporation, with all its aspects. This is how facility strongly impacts the brand experience. Facility Management is the method that can decode the intangible corporate branding into tangible office environments and add value to the core business. It allows the business to keep clients and employees as well as make significant contributions to the market.</p>
<h2>The Brand Is Your Calls To Action.</h2>
<p>In the world of web designing, CTA, a contraction of the call to action is a guideline to the usesrs generated to incite an immediate response. It could be “join us,” call now,&#8221; &#8220;find out more,&#8221; “click here” or &#8220;visit a store today.&#8221;</p>
<p>If an American Baptist minister and activist, Martin Luther King had offered people free toasters when they were marching on Washington, this would have been his brand. Your call to actions is offerings that should be brave, bold, inspiring and consistent with some powerful strategies. They should be sensible. They should deserve to be your brand.</p>
<h2>The Brand Is Your Strategy.</h2>
<p>Your brand is your strategy. Your brand is the method you choose to identify your target audience, their age group, their preferences, and their expectations. Your brand is the tactic you choose to market your products and get more sales.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean that logo is nothing for your business or brand. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">The logo is like your brand&#8217;s first face or impression</a>. But, it is not your brand, only.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why wait any longer to create and deliver a strong persona of your brand to the customers. Just, work hard from the very beginning and get more eyeballs with your unique brand identity. And for the <a href="https://peartland.com.au/creating-a-unique-brand-identity/">unique brand identity you must have to do something unique</a>, but don’t worry you can take help with the ways I’ve mentioned below.</p>
<p>So, scroll through:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Be very clear about the goals, ambitions, and capabilities</h1>
<p>It is very crucial to be clear about organization’s goals, ambitions and capabilities. The questions like, what do you want to be and are you really that now? If you are that, how do you deliver a message to your people? It is just important to grasp the business’ current situation, where it wants to be and what it can achieve in coming few years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Understand the customer, and what drives buying in your category and the segment you are pointing</h1>
<p>Another important thing which I think most important is to study your customers. In case if you have no time to take a time-consuming surveys of market and audience, simple hire sales director to ease your workflow. Another option is a proxy, in case if you can’t go to the customers then get a proxy. Just make sure your brand is customer-centric.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Tell an emotional story to your audience</h1>
<p>Emotional and sad stories are two entirely different genres. So, don’t confuse or mix one with other. Your goal is to develop an effective brand identity, and for this, your task should be around the emotions of your customers. Yes, you have to play with their emotions wisely and with love.</p>
<p>Emotional stories excite people more, make them laugh or make them feel inspective. So, you have to create your emotional story. Ask yourself what type of emotion does your brand typically produce from customers? If you are an e-commerce brand, you probably have to say something about the ease of online shopping. Tell stories through video, photo and written content, whatever you think work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Analyze and Refine the Brand Identity</h1>
<p>We all know how tough it can be for a person to create a brand, he has to go through too many technical and daunting tasks. And, it would be so difficult to change it. Once you have established your brand, it is your duty to routinely examine and refine their brand to make sure it&#8217;s delivering on the promises of what the business stands for.</p>
<p>As Raquel Baldelomar said, “<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">One of the benefits of digital advertising is the ability to track, target, and test new strategies and tactics</a>. Your brand identity should not just be a mission statement on the wall and logo. Your brand is a reflection of your chracter, your thinking, and your values’.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The logo is a face of the brand that explains what your brand is. Designing a right logo can lead your business towards success. Logo designing is not an easy task; it requires strong research about the ongoing and even upcoming tends.</p>
<p>Following are the five essential tips to know for crafting a killer logo:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/02/27/8-effective-seo-tips-rank-beginner-website/">8 effective SEO tips to rank beginner website</a></p>
<h1>Identify your brand</h1>
<p>The logo is an explanation of your business that should be potent enough to communicate with the targeted audience. Therefore, it should possess all the elements of the business that are mandatory to be delivered to the audience. List the things about your brand and especially its ideology. Link your ideologies with symbols and elements that best convey your brand`s message and use these elements smartly to create a logo. Be precise, use hidden clues and follow ‘less is more strategy’.</p>
<h2>Color’s psyche</h2>
<p>Remember your brand’s logo is not just a small colorful image. In fact, it involves a whole psyche of colors behind each element. Color psyche is vital to know in <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">logo designing</a>.  Some shades of colors are considered as harsh while some are cool. According to the color theory, the red color is considered as energetic while the orange shade produces friendly or youthful vibes. Yellow is used for cheerfulness, and the green color is for instructional purposes. The blue tones are used in professional or medical product logo.  Purple is for spirituality, black demonstrates power, white reflects simplicity, whereas pink color is commonly used in toys or other babies’ stuff. So try to opt the most appropriate color as per your business nature and customers psyche.</p>
<h2>Timelessness</h2>
<p>Timelessness matters a lot. Because you’re crafting a logo that will stay for years. So, try to come up with a design that is productive enough to interact with the people of not only today but tomorrow. Study deeply about the social transformations; how choices are changing, what are the values of people and other social trends. While studying the present design trends, try to predict the upcoming trends and make your logo accordingly.</p>
<h2>Thorough Research</h2>
<p>Research is mandatory in every aspect of designing to get success, including <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/02/the-ultimate-guide-to-logo-design/">logo designing.</a> Even the brands with the big name have their separate research team that is responsible for brief market trends, social aspects, market drifts, risk factors, etc. They study audience, their preferences, brand’s competitors, company’s long-term goals and every single aspect of the business that helps logo to stand out from the others.</p>
<p>Most of the start-up companies do not possess separate research panels for designing a logo.Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn`t. But it would be nearly impossible for the logo to fail to grab attention if all the aspects were thoroughly-researched.</p>
<h2>Simplicity and minimalism</h2>
<p>Try to keep logo as simple as possible because your logo will be used everywhere – from site to pamphlets or even from shoes to clothes. The heavy ornamentations, large fonts, clashing colors schemes can ruin your logo.</p>
<p>Consider popular logo designs too, and see how the simplicity works. One of the best examples of simplicity is NIKE, we all know how famous the logo is and how simple it is. It is a perfect example of minimalism approach while creating a logo. On the other hand, complicated logo designs are less likely preferable because complex logos are tough to identify. They are less memorable and less appealing.</p>
<p>Lastly, remember your logo is your brand’s identification. Follow mentioned tips to make a killer logo.</p>

Prepare a  probability graph to calculate ROI of your plan and act accordingly.</p>
<h2>Minimalism</h2>
<p>Extra is not the trend of the market now. <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/minimalism-growth/">Minimalism is the phenomenon</a> of pitching and presenting what is required only. Rather than wasting your time, money and energy on extra ornamentations its good to organize and manage what is important. From the name of your brand till the <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">website design</a> try to hold the approach of minimalism. Simple brand name, logo, packaging, website design, and advertisements are more impactful because they are easy to understand.</p>
<h2>Utilize Maximum Resources</h2>
<p>To market your brand and to add value to it, you can use several platforms at a time to hit the most number of targeted audience. It is not necessary to always focus on paid marketing and advertisements, your marketing plan must include free and easy assessable options as well. For example, social media account management, promotions, and sales for regular followers of the page, V-log, product tutorials etc. Try to utilize most of the available sources so that you can spread your brand more and more within less time.</p>
<h2>Show Your Presence</h2>
<p>Active participation to show your existence helps customers to trust your brand. You can set high positions in the market by grabbing people`s attention at events and celebrations. Your active presence on your social media pages, quick responses for queries of people and visibility in special events will make people think about your brand every time they will be buying certain products or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, you will follow the mentioned techniques to build your brand more effectively and to expand your sales graph.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>User Interface and User Experience are the two terminologies that hold the criteria of good or bad designing in the world of websites. The more user-friendly design is, the more benefits it caters. The major reasons for making design simple and easy to make it understandable. Also, people want a website that guides them with necessary points in an easy yet convincing way.</p>

<h1>More Views More Sales</h1>
<p>The minimal term refers to simplicity in design. The phenomena of removing all unnecessary and decorative elements to make the website design sophisticated and user-friendly is being the current trend. The reason designers are incorporating it into their work is that consumers are found to view such websites more. More views and more exploration on the website directly lead to more sales.</p>
<p>We can say that<a href="https://usabilitygeek.com/less-is-more-importance-minimalist-web-design/"> minimalism approach in designing</a> can make the process of sales easier and faster and this is all that a company wants.</p>
<h2>Time-Saving for Designers and Developers</h2>
<p>Another benefit of minimalism in web designing is the time-saving factor. The whole process of <a href="https://superdevresources.com/web-design-development-blogs/">designing and development</a> is much easier when with minimalism approach in designing is adopted. Today the ongoing trend is of customized website designing so design houses or individual designers cannot pay hours and hours to one project hence they minimalism provides them ease. The design is functional and easily operated that it is proficient for customers.</p>
<h2>Quick look, Quick Decision</h2>
<p>Previously people use to spend hours on the decorative and extra elements, at that time this approach was fascinating because there were limited websites active for any specific service or product but now the competition is tough and people have a lot of options when they search for anything. In such circumstances people open a website, give it a quick look, if they find it easy going or understandable they pay some time to it otherwise they quickly shift to other websites.</p>
<p>For such quick look, quick decision nature of consumers, it is ideal to present things in a way that they get the brand`s message at first glimpse.</p>
<h2>Highlight what is Important</h2>
<p>As the website has selective things it is easy for designers to bring out important things to the front. The simple tactics like changing the size of the font or adding bright colors to key points grab the attention of viewers quickly. Also, consumers find the specific website, easy to explore because they don’t have to dig out required information from a junk of content. Because it highlights what is most important it actually helps users to operate the website easily and somehow convince them to buy mentioned products or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those were some the reason why we think the minimal <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">design is the future of web UI/UX.</a> The most important point is that audience is loving such designs. For a brand as well as for a designer this is the most considerable point of adopting minimalism design approach in future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a regular follower of our blog, you of all people understand what we’ve stressed over from time to time. A brand is undoubtedly the voice of a company. It’s the visual character that interacts with the customers of the company. However, where this brand is connected with the profit of the company, it is also connected to the loss of the company. What people also don’t realize is that the loss of a brand is far worse than the loss of a company or an entity. Allow us to explain how brand loss works.</p>

<h2><strong>So, What is Brand Loss?</strong></h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, brand loss and company loss is not the same thing. The loss of a company basically refers to loss in shares of a corporate entity working in the background. Loss in trade and/or shares are great examples of what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Brand loss, however, refers to loss in followers, loss in engagement, loss in customer loyalty and the list goes on. How are both of these things any different? Well, when the loss of a company occurs, it can be handled easily. The loss in shares or trade occurs in the background and does not have any effect on the reputation of the whole entity. However, brand loss directly relates to continuous loss in the company. What this means is that during a brand loss the loss doesn’t stop at a point and continues to grow since it’s a direct hit on the company.</p>
<h2><strong>Sustaining Brand Loss </strong></h2>
<p>There are several ways to sustain brand loss. One of the most proven ways to sustain brand loss is to work on the overall current existence of the brand. This is partly where a brand revamp can help out the most. In addition, complete brand shifts can be helpful as well. If a brand is continuously providing loss to the company, it might be time to invest in a new brand.</p>
<p>Advertising and revamping the brand completely is undoubtedly the right option to save yourself from the wrath of such a loss. If not controlled, this loss can even go on to become the resulting factor to shutting down a working entity. Want to share your take on brand loss? Share it with us in the comment section below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever gotten a beautiful design idea and failed to create it? We’ve all been there. Not everyone is an artist at heart. Part of why design and branding agencies exist. You can always provide them with the idea you have in mind and they can provide you with the designs. This idea that you put forward to an agency is known as design brief.</p>
<p>Some of the best agencies in the world focus on creating a design that the customer wants. The design brief carries huge importance for both the designer and the client. But hey, why the importance? The clearer your brief is, the better your design can be.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/07/20/essential-things-to-keep-in-mind-before-a-brand-revamp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential Things To Keep In Mind Before A Brand Revamp</a></strong></p>
<h1><strong>Things To Focus On The Design Brief:</strong></h1>
<p>Generally, people believe that a design brief is only describing what the design needs to be like. In reality, it needs to be more elaborative and discrete. So, without further ado, let us discuss the things you need to focus on when submitting a design brief.</p>
<h2><strong>Be Specific</strong></h2>
<p>Try to be as specific as you can. If you talk about fairy meadows in your logo design and receive just a flower as part of the actual thing, don’t be surprised. Your design brief wasn’t specific. For a brand identity, as beautiful as you want it, you need clarity in your statements. You can even submit a roughly drawn brief. It doesn’t matter if it looks bad, it will make it easier on the designer to get the idea.</p>
<h2><strong>Be Open To Suggestions</strong></h2>
<p>One thing you need to understand is that you’re <em>not </em>an artist while they <em>are. </em>Yes, you might feel like the idea you have is amazing while the designer might not feel so. While it might seem frustrating, it shouldn’t be. Trust your designer. Understand that all he or she wants is your design to look better. If you can’t let that happen, you’ll be wasting your own time. Expecting a design that you need is important, but acknowledging other concepts is also part of the play.</p>
<h2><strong>Be Strict On Deadlines</strong></h2>
<p>Being a brand identity deSignagency, we understand how important your time is. One of the many reasons why The Web Founders follows deadlines strictly. However, not all designers work that way. Don’t let a delay be part of the schedule. Don’t follow unrealistic deadlines either. In fact, it would be great if you keep your deSignagency in the loop for this design. However, once a deadline is decided, stick to it.</p>
<p>All in all, the design brief is a very important document that you need to submit in case you need a custom design made. Have your design brief ready? Don’t know which company to choose? Reach us at The Web Founders today!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, it’s been a while since you’ve been running a brand and you’ve seen it grow gradually. You’ve seen the ups and the downs of your brand and you feel like the brand is constantly underperforming. Well, it’s now time to get yourself a brand revamp. Clearly your brand is at a decline and it will start going into loss if you don’t go over a brand revamp soon enough.</p>
<h1>So, What Exactly is a Brand Revamp?</h1>
<p>A brand revamp, as the name suggests it is when a brand revisits its branding and marketing solutions completely to meet a client’s needs. Your customer will only remain your customer if you move in parallel with the competition. Traditionally, each brand needs to go through a phase of revamping at the end of a decade or two depending on the future-proof brand strategy.</p>
<p>Before heading over to give your brand a revamp, it might not seem important but it actually is to focus on a few things. In this blog, we’ll be talking about a few things that you need to keep in mind before moving forward to a brand revamp.</p>
<p><strong>Also </strong>Read:<strong> <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/07/21/design-brief-things-you-need-focus/">Design Brief – Things You Need To Focus On</a></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Futureproof The Strategy</strong></h2>
<p>How long did your last brand strategy work? If the answer is over a decade, well done! Stick to a similar strategy. However, if the answer is something close to less than 5 years, you need to focus on futureproofing your strategy. Do an in-depth check on what your strategy includes, and try to pick out the elements that need futureproofing.</p>
<h2><strong>Pay Special Attention To Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>Your brand identity is an important aspect of your brand that needs to be paid attention to. Keep your eyes when choosing to go for a revamp in this category. Usually the brand identity doesn’t face a huge change, however, it is molded in such a way that it targets a newer audience. If your brand has started to face loss, then it just might be time to create new brand identity completely from scratch.</p>
<p>All in all, you need to be very careful when choosing to go for a brand identity revamp. For everything else, you can always reach us at The Web Founders.</p>
