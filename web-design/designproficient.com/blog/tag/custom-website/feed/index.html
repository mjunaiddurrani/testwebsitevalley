				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.webvanta.com/post/2014-08-04/10-tips-for-creating-websites-that-are-easy-to-maintain">Writing for a custom website is not a piece of cake</a>. If not done wisely, can ruin the complete persona of your website. No matter what and how your web design is making a striking impression by its appearance, the content writing is also worthy of remark. The content of your site should be readable, graspable and appealing to the readers. In this way, the conversational style works best. You have to destroy jargon, avid obscure acronyms, use active voice more, and set goals for your web content.</p>
<p>For your convenience, I’ve gathered some of the useful writing prescriptions for the web. So, scroll through:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/02/4-ways-developing-effective-brand-identity/">4 WAYS TO DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE BRAND IDENTITY</a></p>
<h1>1.    Start with setting the Tone</h1>
<p>There are two important things to give importance before explaining the appropriate tone of your site. Your target audience and what your website is aiming to achieve. So, start with asking &#8212; who’s your target audience? How old are they? Where they live? What values do they give importance to? Most importantly, what their preferences are? And about website, is it an e-commerce website? Is it about educational purpose?</p>
<p>Your audience and your professional website,<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web"> both are important when it comes to writing content on your site</a>. By knowing your audience precisely you may craft writing relevant to their interest in your site.</p>
<h1>2. Be professional AND human</h1>
<p>Try to avoid adding too much marketing jargon. By doing this, you are isolating yourself, as people don’t feel like they’re being sold. In this age, we are surrounded by a number of ads. Find out the appropriate way to present your business clearly, without losing your human face. Even, I also believe that people respond more quickly and better when they can see the professional man in front of him.</p>
<h1>3. Be concise</h1>
<p>You will be wonder to know that average attention span of a web user is not more than 7 seconds. By this, it meant that you have to make these limited time appealing enough to attract more eyeballs. It’s better to be creative and smart. But, everything is good if it remains in accord. Give your people the information they want before they lose their interest in your writing and head back to Google.</p>
<p>Being a writer, your aim should be and must be to avoid unnecessary or needless words in a sentence. Unnecessary words result in idleness.  You can achieve efficiency in your writing by using precise and concise words or phrases that denote some strong meaning and have power. The easy way to do so is to write everything you want and then eliminate those words from a context or sentence which you think are not contributing much. In other words, if a word can be eliminated from a text without affecting its meaning, it should be removed.</p>
<h1>4.    Use short words Use short sentences Use short paragraphs</h1>
<p>Do not go for long and complicated sentences. Shorter sentences are better than the longer ones. In fact, the short sentence is better because in this way there&#8217;s less risk of grammatical mistakes.</p>
<h1>5.    Focus on headlines</h1>
<p>Headling or titles that contain amazing adjectives are more likely to attract a lot more likes. On the other hand, if you see content with less-compelling headlines not get more clicks or retweets. So, try to incorporate highly-persuasive adjectives into your headlines.</p>
<p>So, these are some of the most important writing prescription for the web. I hope you like my blog!</p>

Alternately, designers and marketers need to take a more tactical line of attack.

<h1>HIGHLIGHT YOUR CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTONS ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h1>
<p>Placing a call to action on your website is not tough, but putting them in the right place is essential. Build your CTA wisely to get more eyeballs of visitors and induce them to click. Offer your visitors things that they can&#8217;t refuse.</p>
<p>The call to action, better known as the “CTA,” is an appeal to visitors, inviting their response on a webpage, acting as an indication that guides the user through the next steps. If your call to action is not clear enough then the user may not know the following steps to take to purchase a product or sign up for a newsletter. In many cases, visitors leave the website without completing their task.</p>
<h2>USE TWITTER FOR LEAD GENERATION ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h2>
<p>The platform works almost for every business. The task is just to discover the right people and engaging them, which can be as simple as following them or taking part in a conversation. For the respective purpose, you can find people using Twitter search with relevant hashtags or keywords, or use LinkedIn to find specialists. You can also take help with some tools like CrowdFire or Followerwonk. The entire process requires a significant amount of time, but if done wisely, can produce prominent consequences. Of course, you have to link your twitter account with your website.</p>
<h2>TEST, TEST, TEST</h2>
<p>One cannot overlook the importance of this process. Variety of testing options available, among them A/B testing can do wonders for knowing your click-through rates and so making them better.</p>
<h2>CREATE A MICRO LANDING PAGE</h2>
<p>You have not more than five seconds to convince people landing on your website to stick around and spend their valuable time on your site. For the respective purpose, the micro landing page is a full-page popup that comes in response to the user behavior. Creating a well-designed micro landing page and adding to the home page can increase conversion rates more than your thinking.</p>
<h2>USE EXPLAINER VIDEOS</h2>
<p>Explainer videos- <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/longer-is-better/">we all know are a perfect thing for attracting visitors to your site</a> and explaining them about the benefits and features of your product on the website. As the average user spends about 10-20 seconds on a website if there is no convincing reason to stay longer. But, adding things to their interests like explainer videos make them stay longer on your site. Moreover, it has emerged as one of the best tools for lead generation.</p>
<h2>END OF THE LINE</h2>
<p>Lastly, leads are imperative, not catching the lead means that website’s visitors are probably lost forever. In fact, lead generation site has noticeable differences compared to the rest.

The more you have streams of driving traffic, the more you will have a chance to improve your site conversion.</p>
<p>There are thousands of ways to groom website traffic, but, I have covered several usual ways using which you will surely generate traffic to your website by just spending a few minutes:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/11/3-awesome-design-techniques-create-better-cta-button/">3 Awesome Design Techniques for Create Better CTA Button</a></p>
<h1>Optimize Your Custom Website</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Optimizing a website to SEO tends to increase website’s ranking.</a> Choose the relevant words to target in your SEO campaigns to increase website traffic. Try to target relevant keywords with searcher’s intent in mind. And if you offer any services, create content around these keywords.</p>
<h1>Give a New Life to Your Old Content and Update It</h1>
<p>This tactic is becoming more popular than ever.</p>
<p>No point in posting more and more articles or blogs on the website if no one will ever read them. Instead, you should discover the web pages that are already giving you traffic, and it is better to update those pages for traffic growth. In fact, Google considers websites with the updated content and will rank them higher in a search engine. Many sites are using this tactic, and you should have to follow them.</p>
<h1>Prefer Some Paid Social Media Promotion</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/importance-social-media-business/">Each social media platform works significantly in advertising and cheaper than many other means of advertising</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter cover almost every audience, allow you to know about competitors and stand out among them. Pinterest is perfect for visual-related businesses, designs, etc. LinkedIn is the best option to target business professionals and getting a high ROI. Choose the best platform according to your niche.</p>
<h1>BLOGGING – Perfect Public Relations Tool</h1>
<p>Blogging drives high traffic. According to the case study blogging can result in 300% traffic boost in just 56 days. And this isn’t rare; another company also ran a similar experiment with even better results.</p>
<p>When you write a blog determine the main keywords that bring visitors to the website. Publish a quality blog post on a consistent basis. Ask questions that are related to your topic and also allow their responses and views. Establish a strong network with other blogs. Share your blog post on different social media platforms.</p>
<h1>Use Email Marketing, It Still Matters</h1>
<p>Email marketing is another usual way to drive traffic to the website. A newsletter is a fantastic tool for driving traffic. Make sure that you have a newsletter opt-in on your site. I would suggest you to use Drip. It’s free and fun to use.</p>
<h1>Make Sure Your Site Is Fast and Responsive</h1>
<p>It is very important for your website to be responsive on both devices: desktop and mobile. Along with responsiveness, the website should be fast as if it fails to load within three seconds then your bounce rate will sky high.</p>
<h1>Keep an Eye on Analytics Data</h1>
<p>Do not take your site analytics for granted, study analytics of your site and use extracted information in improving your content strategies. For the respective purpose, Google analytics is a reliable tool use to optimize website performance and conversions.</p>
<p>Consider mentioned ways to groom your website traffic. Hopefully, they’ll take your website traffic to the sky.</p>
