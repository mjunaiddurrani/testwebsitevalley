				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American billionaire businessman, Scott Cook says, “A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is – it is what consumers tell each other it is.” This valuable quote alone speaks so much about the significance of a brand and its effect beyond our thoughts. Branding depicts the entire personality, equity and image of the company. From logo design to campaign copy everything has a significant contribution in the company’s ideology, philosophy and core purpose of its message can be understood with the right kind of branding.</p>

<p>Branding is the most powerful aspect of your company therefore you should be very careful about what it looks like and what things it shall reflect to your target market. Sometimes there are minor loopholes in your branding strategy that fail the brand and ultimately cause you to revamp the entire image of your brand all over again. Rebranding your company is a tricky decision that may also be pretty costly and companies who consider about rebranding should keep certain things in mind.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips that will help your business with the decision of rebranding taken righteously!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong>Figure out the need</strong></h1>
<p>– Determining the reason for rebranding is very important. The reason could be just anything but defined. It can be anything that covers a negative reputation that your company might have underwent or your customers simply don’t respond you the way you wanted them to. As the reasons are explored, they help you with a proper plan of rebranding.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Create a Plan</strong></h2>
<p>– For all kinds of decisions in any business, a proper roadmap is highly necessary. Once you have noted down the core points that trigger your mind towards getting a revamp on your company’s brand, you must create a plan of how to start doing it. Rebranding can possibly be started as simply as just changing the color of your company’s logo or twisting its design a bit.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Revamp the Logo </strong></h2>
<p>– <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Redesigning the logo will be the most evident step while rebranding as the logo is the prime identity of any company</a>. It would be good to start with it!</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Modify Packaging</strong></h2>
<p>– If you are a company that sells certain kind of products then changing the package designs could also be an important tip. It is believed that the last and closest campaign that a company runs to reach out their customer is the product packaging so this can possibly be an important tool.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Twist your Ad Campaigns </strong></h2>
<p>– If your brand or company has been using a certain kind of content since forever, then maybe this is the right time to twist that a bit to give a revamped message to your audience.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Do some Customer Research</strong></h2>
<p>– Knowing your customers is good but learning what they need is very important. If you know what are the likes and dislikes of your customers, it becomes easier for you to recreate an image that matches well with their taste. Social Media is a helpful tool that can get you an appropriate response.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Change Brand Colors –</strong></h2>
<p>Playing around with your Brand’s color is a risky but effective approach of rebranding. Brand colors have a special kind of identity associated with your company.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Compare your Brand</strong></h2>
<p>– A sensible comparison between you and your competitors done beforehand can result in a proactive attempt for rebranding. You can learn from the achievements and mistakes made by them.</li>
<li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days when a logo was considered everything to the business or brand. It is not. A custom logo does not represent your philosophy, your societies, or your story, does not legitimize your business, and it is not your brand. Then, what is the brand?</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/07/5-writing-prescription-web/">5 Writing Prescription for the Web</a></p>
<h1>The Brand Is Your People.</h1>
<p>Your people are a better contender for your brand and also the way they behave. This means, your brand is as valuable as your people. Let’s take a look at some of the big global household brands like GSK, P&amp;G or Unilever; you know them primarily through their consumers. These brands are being used by 2 billion people every day.</p>
<h2>The Brand Is Your Value.</h2>
<p><a href="https://99designs.com/blog/tips/types-of-logos/">Your brand is more than that colorful little image which we all call Logo or a custom logo</a>. Instead, your brand is guarantees and values you offer to the people. It should be promising and valuable. It is a relationship—a strong one with your customers. It trusts you build. It is an inspiration, and the list is endless.</p>
<h2>The Brand Is The Way You Speak.</h2>
<p>Your brand is your voice. The more strong voice, the more strong your brand. In this way, using old copy is a quick way to end-up with ordinary or worst consequences. If you are letting acronyms, social service jargon, and complex concepts contaminate everything you say, that’s your brand. If it’s trying to be all things to all people, that’s your brand. In other words, your action is your brand. Your voice is your brand. Whatever you do or doing is your brand.</p>
<h2>The Brand is Facilities you provide.</h2>
<p>In a competitive market, product uniqueness is no longer adequate to retain credible competitive benefits. Today, business has to position the overall corporation, with all its aspects. This is how facility strongly impacts the brand experience. Facility Management is the method that can decode the intangible corporate branding into tangible office environments and add value to the core business. It allows the business to keep clients and employees as well as make significant contributions to the market.</p>
<h2>The Brand Is Your Calls To Action.</h2>
<p>In the world of web designing, CTA, a contraction of the call to action is a guideline to the usesrs generated to incite an immediate response. It could be “join us,” call now,&#8221; &#8220;find out more,&#8221; “click here” or &#8220;visit a store today.&#8221;</p>
<p>If an American Baptist minister and activist, Martin Luther King had offered people free toasters when they were marching on Washington, this would have been his brand. Your call to actions is offerings that should be brave, bold, inspiring and consistent with some powerful strategies. They should be sensible. They should deserve to be your brand.</p>
<h2>The Brand Is Your Strategy.</h2>
<p>Your brand is your strategy. Your brand is the method you choose to identify your target audience, their age group, their preferences, and their expectations. Your brand is the tactic you choose to market your products and get more sales.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean that logo is nothing for your business or brand. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">The logo is like your brand&#8217;s first face or impression</a>. But, it is not your brand, only.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why wait any longer to create and deliver a strong persona of your brand to the customers. Just, work hard from the very beginning and get more eyeballs with your unique brand identity. And for the <a href="https://peartland.com.au/creating-a-unique-brand-identity/">unique brand identity you must have to do something unique</a>, but don’t worry you can take help with the ways I’ve mentioned below.</p>
<p>So, scroll through:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Be very clear about the goals, ambitions, and capabilities</h1>
<p>It is very crucial to be clear about organization’s goals, ambitions and capabilities. The questions like, what do you want to be and are you really that now? If you are that, how do you deliver a message to your people? It is just important to grasp the business’ current situation, where it wants to be and what it can achieve in coming few years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Understand the customer, and what drives buying in your category and the segment you are pointing</h1>
<p>Another important thing which I think most important is to study your customers. In case if you have no time to take a time-consuming surveys of market and audience, simple hire sales director to ease your workflow. Another option is a proxy, in case if you can’t go to the customers then get a proxy. Just make sure your brand is customer-centric.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Tell an emotional story to your audience</h1>
<p>Emotional and sad stories are two entirely different genres. So, don’t confuse or mix one with other. Your goal is to develop an effective brand identity, and for this, your task should be around the emotions of your customers. Yes, you have to play with their emotions wisely and with love.</p>
<p>Emotional stories excite people more, make them laugh or make them feel inspective. So, you have to create your emotional story. Ask yourself what type of emotion does your brand typically produce from customers? If you are an e-commerce brand, you probably have to say something about the ease of online shopping. Tell stories through video, photo and written content, whatever you think work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Analyze and Refine the Brand Identity</h1>
<p>We all know how tough it can be for a person to create a brand, he has to go through too many technical and daunting tasks. And, it would be so difficult to change it. Once you have established your brand, it is your duty to routinely examine and refine their brand to make sure it&#8217;s delivering on the promises of what the business stands for.</p>
<p>As Raquel Baldelomar said, “<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">One of the benefits of digital advertising is the ability to track, target, and test new strategies and tactics</a>. Your brand identity should not just be a mission statement on the wall and logo. Your brand is a reflection of your chracter, your thinking, and your values’.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media with 3 billion social network users around the world can be used for a range of purposes. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">The platform gives you the perfect opportunity to reach your target audience, build your product and know your rivals in the market.</a></p>
<p>Social media branding is all about the experience audience have with your product virtually. When it’s done correctly, it can and will help you connect to your target market in an ideal way.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we have to bring some little changes in our social media profiles. However, these type of changes come with quite a bit of stress and can be an overwhelming experience. In fact, it can put your online reputation in danger.</p>
<p>To be very honest, rebranding is not an easy task, if not done correctly can end up with a disaster. Proper planning, preparation, and thorough research are the things you must have to do before changing or launching your new Brand web-based social media image</p>
<p>So, let’s begin the journey:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/23/5-awesome-practices-responsive-web-design-professional-web-design-company/">5 AWESOME PRACTICES OF RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN FOR PROFESSIONAL WEB DESIGN COMPANY</a></p>
<h1>Firstly, Why Change the Image of Brand Web-Based Social Media?</h1>
<p>Before going through the process, we should see why we need to change to bring a change:</p>
<ul>
<li>When changing core values of your business</li>
<li>When you observe visuals are not interactive</li>
<li>When you have to reach a new audience</li>
<li>When you’re entering a new market</li>
<li>When you’re changing your product offerings</li>
</ul>
<p>Then,</p>
<h2>1.    Process with Highly-Organized Manner</h2>
<p>For many people, just the mere thought of getting organized can be intimidating. Keeping yourself organized is one of your strengths, it&#8217;s a habit everyone should get into. And here, you cannot ignore the importance of organizing your efforts.</p>
<p>When it comes to rebranding your business in social media, it&#8217;s crucial to realize that you only get one chance at a first impact, and hurrying the process can end up with a serious blunder. Well, thorough-research is your knight in shining armor. So, research everything from the social media platforms to the new expected audience and everything.</p>
<h2>2.    Let Your Audience Know About Your Plans</h2>
<p>Your followers, lovers, and customers should know about each and everything you’re going to do about your business. Not just to avoid panic, also connecting your social media community with your brand, it is crucial. By doing this, you’ll get their recognition, trust and probably their sweet help.</p>
<h2>3.    Research Each Social Media Platforms</h2>
<p>Whether it’s branding or rebranding social media profiles, the thorough research of each platform is a way to shoot. Once you have all your work organized, inform the audience about your plans, it’s time to find out the limitations behind each social media platform that might limit your capacity to change your Brand web-based social media profile. For instance:</p>
<p>Facebook – With 1.86 billion monthly active users, Facebook, is a great medium to market your brand, however, when it comes to rebranding page, this tool is overly defensive. Like, if you have more than 200 likes, you cannot switch your business page name. However, you have to make an entirely new page and in the result losing old followers.</p>
<p>LinkedIn – The rebranding is more complicated and more stringent here. Group profiles can change not more than five times, whereas for changing Company Pages you have to contact the LinkedIn Help Center &#8212; which is the daunting task.</p>
<p>Twitter – Comparatively, it gives you a quick and straightforward solution to change username and profile information.</p>
<h2>4.    Make No Compromise with Professionalism and Consistency</h2>
<p>It is crucial for you to update all your social media profiles on the same day, before your declaration. It will help you to deliver a professional image of your company to the people. To reduce the possibility of misunderstanding, make sure that your messages are consistent across all platforms.</p>
<h2>5.    Remember: It is more than just Changes names</h2>
<p>Of course,<a href="https://moz.com/blog/how-to-rebrand-your-social-media-accounts"> a rebranding is more than just switching names on social media networks</a>. You have to make sure your social media messages are well-aligned with your content, and PR. You also have to answer back to the people reaching out to you.</p>
<p>The goals should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make our followers pleased with the rebrand.</li>
<li>Answer all questions or queries, promptly, about the brand.</li>
<li>Have full coverage for launch.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, these are the things you have to make sure when changing your social media brand image. I hope, all these mentioned content might help you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s not that difficult to get busy in the day to day workings of your business. You may think that you have less or no time to make your online presence prominent. Many of us feel about content or products as the lifeblood of great brand experiences. But most of us take for granted the <a href="https://www.bluefrogdm.com/blog/brand-strategy-the-top-5-benefits-of-rebranding">importance of having a great design in rebranding.</a></p>
<p>But, why brands need to take a step of rebranding their existing brands?</p>
<p>Being a businessperson, you can have many reasons as to why you want to rebrand your existing business. It will benefit you to list down all your aims and objectives before starting anything or else the idea to rebrand will only run down your business’ image.</p>
<p>When you already know about your objectives you can prepare yourself better and make yourself more attentive towards the act. Some of the good reasons for rebranding could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the existing persona of your company</li>
<li><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Give importance to the new set of brand promotions</a></li>
<li>Deal or recover with the negative image of the business</li>
</ul>

<h1>Here’s why great design matters to your brand:</h1>
<p>No doubt people coming from different backgrounds love things that are well-structured or have an appealing design. Like, a trendy new restaurant will make more customers if it has an enthralling design compared to that one with unappealing designed. In fact, there are many studies which show that great brand design not only makes people cheerier, it also makes them pay more money for your brand.</p>
<p>Like, there are numerous local neighborhood restaurants which have been running successfully for decades and do the fine job without any flashy branding sparkles. They still perform their tasks what people need – offer delicious food and best services.</p>
<h2>Other Reasons: Why Great Design Matters For Rebrand your Brand?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Even dots and dashes matter in your design. If you give importance to details, then you will be perceived as a premium by your customers.</li>
<li>The first impression is the last impression. It is true, and you can create strong experiences. Especially, if you’re a new brand owner.</li>
<li>You can make your customers feel better and as I said above to make them spend more time on your product.</li>
<li>The excellent design ensures your content remains user-friendly and so search friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Lastly, I would say rebranding your existing brand can be equally difficult as branding the first time. Whether you are doing this for the first time or the third time you need to be very careful about every step.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a business owner or a marketer it is your utmost priority to build a value by associating all good with your brand&#8217;s name. But it is not a simple task.  Strong brand image leads to the popularity of the brand and ultimately towards better sales. The competition in the market is high and to stand out you need to follow some smart tactics.</p>
<p>Following I have mentioned some point that can help you build your brand smartly and effectively for proficient results.</p>

<h1> SWOT</h1>
<p>Create a plan before pitching anything to your clients. Your small mistake can ruin your image in the market and can make you suffer a lot. SWOT analysis of your idea can help you understand the strength and weaknesses. You can calculate the risk of failure and can redesign your strategy for better results.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Keeping an eye on your goal is the right way to stand in the market. Target the audience first according to the requirements of your niche and stay focus on the psychology they follow before making a sale. Then market your brand in a way that your message and best features of your product reach the maximum number of relevant audience. Prepare a  probability graph to calculate ROI of your plan and act accordingly.</p>
<h2>Minimalism</h2>
<p>Extra is not the trend of the market now. <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/minimalism-growth/">Minimalism is the phenomenon</a> of pitching and presenting what is required only. Rather than wasting your time, money and energy on extra ornamentations its good to organize and manage what is important. From the name of your brand till the <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">website design</a> try to hold the approach of minimalism. Simple brand name, logo, packaging, website design, and advertisements are more impactful because they are easy to understand.</p>
<h2>Utilize Maximum Resources</h2>
<p>To market your brand and to add value to it, you can use several platforms at a time to hit the most number of targeted audience. It is not necessary to always focus on paid marketing and advertisements, your marketing plan must include free and easy assessable options as well. For example, social media account management, promotions, and sales for regular followers of the page, V-log, product tutorials etc. Try to utilize most of the available sources so that you can spread your brand more and more within less time.</p>
<h2>Show Your Presence</h2>
<p>Active participation to show your existence helps customers to trust your brand. You can set high positions in the market by grabbing people`s attention at events and celebrations. Your active presence on your social media pages, quick responses for queries of people and visibility in special events will make people think about your brand every time they will be buying certain products or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, you will follow the mentioned techniques to build your brand more effectively and to expand your sales graph.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It should be a humble effort to cater to maximum needs and desires of the targeted audience through your online portal which, at times, may be devoid of any physical existence. As such, the path to convincing the audience with regards to something that is intangible in its form might be found strewn with hardships if your website lacks a professional appearance. We, as experts, serve as your reliable guide or would love to work for you as your proxy, while remaining in your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/09/06/5-exceptional-ways-boost-roi-design/">5 Exceptional Ways to Boost ROI with Design</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Out-of-the-box content: </strong>All content related to your online business should be fresh, crisp and serve as a means of attracting ever-increasing traffic to your portal. Reading stuff that is engaging and engrossing does magical feats for you, especially if you are part of a start-up. Visitors translated into customers may often aid your business by spreading the word among their circles, advocating and recommending your offer far and wide; the best part of it is that this goal is achieved at virtually NO cost at all!</li>
<li><strong>Offer what is mostly demanded: </strong>In order to prolong your stay in the market and perform with an above-average score, keeping yourself abreast with the ongoing market trends is inevitable. You can hardly expect a moderate boost in your sales adhering to the traditional and mediocre style of doing things which would have witnessed an exponential elevation in sales graph, had the scenario been otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the social media platform on its toes: </strong>Social Media Marketing (<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">SMM</a>) or more technically, Digital Media Marketing (DMM) is the name of the game played these days. Its only here that a Universal principle can be violated with perfect ease: <strong>“With minimal input, you are able to acquire an output several times the input.”</strong> Considered as a link that “redirects” your visitors or clients to your actual website, a social media page or account should be deemed of lesser importance in no way whatsoever. Speaking in a different tone, social media act as windows or more aptly, ventilators, to offer a gentle blow of fresh air to all its maniacs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keeping and proving yourself “in”:</strong> Presenting yourself as a favorable option against your competitors for a customer sounds as good as turning yourself a priority over others for a given client. Although being a formidable one, this target can well be achieved through constant and regular SEO activity within your setup, building up your customer-base and keeping it intact.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re one of those brand enthusiasts who love to keep their eyes tightly packed on major brands, you’re probably well-aware of the huge brand crisis that Pepsi faced. It was due to the malfunction in the advertisement that Pepsi recently released. The advertisement was aimed to reflect on equality, well&#8230;at least it aimed to do that. Because that really isn’t what actually happened and it turned out to be an absolute disaster. The advertisement had such a negative impact on the audience that the multinational corporation had to take it down and apologize to the audience.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few months and the company is back on track. In fact, nobody really remembers if that advertisement even existed. So, what happened? Well, what happened was that the PR department of Pepsi worked on the image of the whole application by applying the image repair theory. It’s easy to understand really all you have to focus on is a few simple steps.</p>
<p><strong>Also </strong>Read: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/07/31/brand-loss-things-contain-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Brand Loss – Things You Should Do To Contain Customers</strong></a></p>
<h1>So, what is Image Repair Theory?</h1>
<p>Well, in simple words, the Image Repair Theory is a small formula to use when a brand crisis occurs and the image of your brand is at risk. The image repair theory or the IMT basically allows you to focus on how you can get your brand back on track regardless of all the crisis that it has been facing. There are a few small steps that you need to follow in this regard.</p>
<h2><strong>Understand the complexity</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing that you need to understand is how complex is the situation. Panicking is the least that needs to be on your mind. Keep in mind that these things happen when you’re handling a brand and it is very easy to get rid of. Keep your head straight and preferably a team of consultants with you whenever you take any step.</p>
<h2><strong>Time To Brainstorm </strong></h2>
<p>Like I said, its preferable to have a team of consultants with you whenever you take a decision. However, it is also preferable to brainstorm a set of ideas with the desired team. In fact, take as many teams that you may want to brainstorm exactly the right solution. After you think that you have the right answer to get rid of the problem, apply and voila! You’re almost done.</p>
<h2><strong>Take Necessary Steps</strong></h2>
<p>Think there are some necessary steps that the situation demands? Well, go ahead and take them if the situation demands it. Keep in mind that the image of your brand is the most important thing hanging in the balance. If there are options that can be taken in order to protect it, be the first one to take action.</p>
<p>All in all, brand crisis isn’t as horrifying as it sounds like if taken care of properly. Think we missed out on something? Be the first one to tell us in the comments section!</p>
