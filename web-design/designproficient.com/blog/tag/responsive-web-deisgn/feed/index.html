Web development is a complex technical field which requires every developer to keep learning new things to increase his proficiency and to hold a solid grasp of expertise in coding and programming websites.</p>
<p>Here are the three modern techniques every web developer should know about:</p>

<h1>CSS 3 media queries</h1>
<p>Css3 media queries are the fundamental building block elements of a <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">responsive website design</a>. These are syntax command code in a cascading style sheet module used to define set of parameters to modify the desktop screen resolution sizes and mobile browser viewport width.</p>
<p>The CSS3 media queries are used to apply styles with the CSS modules by using the @media and @import at-rules. It is also used to target specific media for the &lt;link&gt;, &lt;source&gt;, and other HTML elements. Moreover, it is further used to test media queries by using the Window.match media () and MediaQueryList.addlistener () JavaScript methods.</p>
<p>Following is the code to illustrate the CSS media queries with example:</p>
<p>@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {</p>
<p>#container {</p>
<p>Width: 320px;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Header h1#logo a {</p>
<p>Width: 320px;</p>
<p>Height: 44px;</p>
<p>Background: url (image-small.jpg) no-repeat 0 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Font resizing with REM</h1>
<p>Font resizing is a root element in Cascading style sheet to make it easier to increase and decrease the size of fonts by inches. It provides a relative measurement of length in the HTML element and defines in a percentage in the HTML body and h1 header tag.</p>
<p>Here is the font resizing code with root em:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Html {font-size: 62.5 %;}</p>
<p>Body {font-size: 1.4rem ;} /* =14px */</p>
<p>h1 {font-size: 2.4rem ;} /* =24px */</p>
<h1>Cache pages for offline usage</h1>
<p>Cache manifest is a new feature in the Html 5 web element which helps users to easily visit the website while being offline. It helps in navigating offline web pages with a faster loading speed and reduced load server.</p>
<p>Following is the code for offline cache pages:</p>
<p>Add-Type text/cache-manifest .manifest</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CACHE MANIFEST</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CACHE</p>
<p>index.html</p>
<p>style.css</p>
<p>image.jpg</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;html manifest=&#8221;/offline. Manifest&#8221;&gt;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">Responsive design is becoming a need for a professional web deSignagency</a>. Because, it can solve a lot of problems – will improve the way your website looks on devices, make your site user-friendly, and make the users spend more time on website. In fact, it can help you improve your site ranking in search engines. Unfortunately, most of the brands don’t know that more than half of the users on a website are from mobile. However, the percentage of mobile users will continue to grow in coming few years. If your company’s website is not responsive, then here are few best practices you can do to make it responsive for both- desktop and mobile users.</p>
<p>Here is the list of things you can do to make responsive professional website:</p>

<h1>ADAPTABLE ON ALL DEVICES</h1>
<p>Responsive design is something that fits on all type of the devices: desktop, mobile, and tablet. One can deliver a great experience through it. I already mentioned that mobile responsiveness is essential ranking factor. In fact, it is a first step in creating a responsive web page that fulfils the demands of its users. For true responsive design, every element of a website’s markup should be context-aware and balance with the screen.</p>
<h2>INTUITIVE NAVIGATION</h2>
<p>Intuitive navigation is another critical website element to have a responsive and successful website. It means that your site is created in such a way that website traffic streams from web page to web page. On the other hand, website with a poor user experience will undergo from high rates of leaving.</p>
<h2>CONSISTENCY</h2>
<p>Well-Build navigation is not enough. Design consistency is extremely important. Add consistent elements with clear in goals. Try to know about your audience and their expectations. If you know what users expect to do on your site, then you can design for those prospects. Also, keep pages similar, usable and stay consistent with design and content of your website.</p>
<h2>BOLD TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.webydo.com/blog/graphic-design/typography/11-stunning-typography-examples-from-3-surprising-sources/">Typography is a huge topic when it comes to design a responsive website.</a> Being a designer, it’s your responsibility to know for whom you are designing. If you fail to deliver readable text, you’ll end up with poorly designed website. It is crucial to understand the nature of devices, check which typeface is more suitable for a particular device, and check the distance from which your audience will look at displays. Make sure the letters should be stand out from the background. Also, create a visual rhythm of each element with the wise use of a grid.</p>
<h2>USE OF MICRO INTERACTIONS IN WEBSITE</h2>
<p>The use of micro-interactions is one of the most common things web designer thinking as a trend. Micro-interactions are variables that allow a visitor to interact with a website without reloading it. In fact, they’re the fundamental part of website design, that any site without them will probably look bland and uninteresting. Micro-interactions make the user experience much more fun and also save time.</p>
<p>Consider these practices and make your custom website responsive enough to attract more customers.</p>
