				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, it’s been a while since you’ve been running a brand and you’ve seen it grow gradually. You’ve seen the ups and the downs of your brand and you feel like the brand is constantly underperforming. Well, it’s now time to get yourself a brand revamp. Clearly your brand is at a decline and it will start going into loss if you don’t go over a brand revamp soon enough.</p>
<h1>So, What Exactly is a Brand Revamp?</h1>
<p>A brand revamp, as the name suggests it is when a brand revisits its branding and marketing solutions completely to meet a client’s needs. Your customer will only remain your customer if you move in parallel with the competition. Traditionally, each brand needs to go through a phase of revamping at the end of a decade or two depending on the future-proof brand strategy.</p>
<p>Before heading over to give your brand a revamp, it might not seem important but it actually is to focus on a few things. In this blog, we’ll be talking about a few things that you need to keep in mind before moving forward to a brand revamp.</p>
<p><strong>Also </strong>Read:<strong> <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/07/21/design-brief-things-you-need-focus/">Design Brief – Things You Need To Focus On</a></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Futureproof The Strategy</strong></h2>
<p>How long did your last brand strategy work? If the answer is over a decade, well done! Stick to a similar strategy. However, if the answer is something close to less than 5 years, you need to focus on futureproofing your strategy. Do an in-depth check on what your strategy includes, and try to pick out the elements that need futureproofing.</p>
<h2><strong>Pay Special Attention To Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>Your brand identity is an important aspect of your brand that needs to be paid attention to. Keep your eyes when choosing to go for a revamp in this category. Usually the brand identity doesn’t face a huge change, however, it is molded in such a way that it targets a newer audience. If your brand has started to face loss, then it just might be time to create new brand identity completely from scratch.</p>
<p>All in all, you need to be very careful when choosing to go for a brand identity revamp. For everything else, you can always reach us at The Web Founders.</p>
