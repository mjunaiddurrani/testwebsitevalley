				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every web design company on the Internet calls itself the best web designer. Many web design companies do this to brag, while many are in favor of better markets and customers. In today&#8217;s world, every business needs an attractive website to grow. Website designers play a critical role in getting sites to attract users. However, market availability is high, so it is difficult to assess which company should take advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>To create the right website for your business, you need to find the <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">best web design companies</a> that understands your business and goals and provides the ideal site on time and budget. But how do you find an excellent web deSignagency? Many web deSignagencies give you the right directions, but few are real exceptions. Finding them is not easy, but in this blog post we can help you that how you can choose the best web design company that meets your needs</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Pricing and Charges </strong></h3>
<p>Cheap and low prices don&#8217;t mean poor quality, but they are a way for web design companies to provide services to clients. The best in the industry prefer to contact them for information about software packages or services. Unless you say you want to develop a web design plan, you may not be able to provide that information.</p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t the web deSignagency send you the price directly by phone or email? Because the best web deSignagency is qualified and needs to understand your requirements before making an offer or proposal. However, if the first question is about prices, some web designers or freelancers will tell prices directly. They know that you care about the price, not the service.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Past Projects and Clients </strong></h3>
<p>The best web designers in the world have a vast experience in web design and know everything from the schemes of colors to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Motion-Graphics">graphic design</a>. Every website deSignagency or freelancer already has past clients and their projects. Secure experience is one of the most vital factors. Ask for previous projects that match your goals and activities. Examples of online service and portfolio show the company&#8217;s reputation. So, always work with a company that can show you, different models.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Management of Your Site </strong></h3>
<p>The person responsible for the website is very important. If you work with a representative, you need to obtain the name and contact information of the person responsible for attracting success to the site. These contacts can be project managers, project managers, or solution consultants. Employees of these levels do not condemn staff at lower levels and cannot be able to make excuses for inexplicable reasons.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Customer Support and Maintenance </strong></h3>
<p>Web design companies have an online customer support system to manage your needs. If there is a problem with your site, contact them, and correct the error. Your web design software package or plan may include a web content management system (CMS). The web deSignagency has set up the tools (CMS) necessary to change your site. Although your site includes content management tools, certain types of changes require qualified programmers or designers, for creating new types of page layouts, adding new forms and changing animations.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 5: Set Deadline and Specific Standards for Your Site </strong></h3>
<p>It is essential to set specific standards with the deadline. This timeline and overview provide a way to track the progress of website deSignagencies. If your partner completes the plan in advance, you have chosen a professional partner. Specific standards include quality, which determines whether a site can be accessed in a mobile platform, the number of visitors supported at any time the site is launched, and ordered maintenance plans.</p>
<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>
<p>When you develop a website, you need a trusted technology partner. If you do not hire an appropriate web design company, your project may not succeed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graphic designing is a worthy skill that can make you earn in millions if only you know how to sell your art in the right manner. It is also true that for a valuable skill you should charge an amount that does justice with your efforts. As a graphic designer, there are many factors that shall lead you towards making a living through your work. A talented, well skilled designer usually know the game and they are pretty good in getting good clients on board and making an impressive portfolio to sell their talent in the market. However, as a new designer in market, it might be a challenge to sell your skills as new entrants are not much familiar with the tariff and rates.</p>
<p>Here are few things that will allow you to predict bidding rates as a new graphic designer in the market!</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/07/19/importance-unique-content-custom-website/">The Importance of Unique Content for Your Custom Website</a></p>
<h1><strong>Check the market rates</strong></h1>
<p>Check out the freelancing websites such as Fiverr and Upwork and go through the rates quoted by new entrants and professionals both on their gigs. Do a contrast of the average rates by them and predict a suitable price that you shall quote to your very first client.</p>
<h2><strong>Project Rates vs. Hourly rates</strong></h2>
<p>There is a different pricing schedule for projects and if you work for someone on hourly basis. All you have to be careful about is what goes out of your wallet before deciding your charges. As a freelancer or home based designer, you have to sensibly evaluate your overheads which includes the electricity and internet. If you are based in an office, your cost breakup shall also include your office expenses. If you use any subscription based resources such as Shutterstock, its subscription break-up shall also make its place in your invoice.</p>
<h2><strong>Apps and Software Cost</strong></h2>
<p>Apps and Software are paid and as a designer you should recover the payment through your work especially if your client is not tech savvy and doesn’t know much about technology and its cost. Photoshop costs £20 a month while Adobe CC kit costs around £45 a month. If you are using one of the apps from Adobe kit, each might cost you somewhere around £20. There even are paid invoice generating software which you might need to use.</p>
<h2><strong>Taxation and Licensing </strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>If you work in an office or even as a freelancer in a country where your income is taxed then you must include the taxation in the invoice to get your expense recovered. Licensing of your work is based on the media in which your artwork will be used by the client. For example if you are designing a billboard or a print ad, it is going to be charged high than a flyer, brochure, visiting card or a social media creative. Similarly, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">website designing</a> also has a different schedule of cost.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">Responsive design is becoming a need for a professional web deSignagency</a>. Because, it can solve a lot of problems – will improve the way your website looks on devices, make your site user-friendly, and make the users spend more time on website. In fact, it can help you improve your site ranking in search engines. Unfortunately, most of the brands don’t know that more than half of the users on a website are from mobile. However, the percentage of mobile users will continue to grow in coming few years. If your company’s website is not responsive, then here are few best practices you can do to make it responsive for both- desktop and mobile users.</p>
<p>Here is the list of things you can do to make responsive professional website:</p>

<h1>ADAPTABLE ON ALL DEVICES</h1>
<p>Responsive design is something that fits on all type of the devices: desktop, mobile, and tablet. One can deliver a great experience through it. I already mentioned that mobile responsiveness is essential ranking factor. In fact, it is a first step in creating a responsive web page that fulfils the demands of its users. For true responsive design, every element of a website’s markup should be context-aware and balance with the screen.</p>
<h2>INTUITIVE NAVIGATION</h2>
<p>Intuitive navigation is another critical website element to have a responsive and successful website. It means that your site is created in such a way that website traffic streams from web page to web page. On the other hand, website with a poor user experience will undergo from high rates of leaving.</p>
<h2>CONSISTENCY</h2>
<p>Well-Build navigation is not enough. Design consistency is extremely important. Add consistent elements with clear in goals. Try to know about your audience and their expectations. If you know what users expect to do on your site, then you can design for those prospects. Also, keep pages similar, usable and stay consistent with design and content of your website.</p>
<h2>BOLD TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.webydo.com/blog/graphic-design/typography/11-stunning-typography-examples-from-3-surprising-sources/">Typography is a huge topic when it comes to design a responsive website.</a> Being a designer, it’s your responsibility to know for whom you are designing. If you fail to deliver readable text, you’ll end up with poorly designed website. It is crucial to understand the nature of devices, check which typeface is more suitable for a particular device, and check the distance from which your audience will look at displays. Make sure the letters should be stand out from the background. Also, create a visual rhythm of each element with the wise use of a grid.</p>
<h2>USE OF MICRO INTERACTIONS IN WEBSITE</h2>
<p>The use of micro-interactions is one of the most common things web designer thinking as a trend. Micro-interactions are variables that allow a visitor to interact with a website without reloading it. In fact, they’re the fundamental part of website design, that any site without them will probably look bland and uninteresting. Micro-interactions make the user experience much more fun and also save time.</p>
<p>Consider these practices and make your custom website responsive enough to attract more customers.</p>

Having said that, if they are used in a wrong way, or over used, they tend to create distractions and annoy the viewers from the actual intended emphasis. The easiest and most effect way to have an impactful design is to keep it as simple and minimalistic as possible.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> 1. Gradients.</strong></p>
<p>Even though advancements in design technologies has allowed the use of gradients to be easily accessible to all designers, its proper use is still considered a difficult art to master. However, the advantages of the impact gradients have on the overall look of a design are undoubtedly noticeable. Listed below are some of the types of gradients that are being used thoroughly by successful designers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal, linear gradient.</li>
<li>Radial gradient.</li>
<li>Diagonal gradient.</li>
<li>Vertical linear fade.</li>
<li>Vertical gradient.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very important to maintain a subtle visual flow at all times when using gradients. This always compliments the overall integrity of the design and helps the rest of the design elements to gel perfectly together.</p>
<p><strong>2. Kerning.</strong></p>
<p>Kerning or letter spacing is a very important skill to be mastered. The perfect letter spacing makes or breaks any kind of design. It plays a very important role in headlines, logos, paragraphs or anything that has text. It’s amazing to notice the impact letter spacing has on a logo design and designers across the globe have started to emphasize significantly more on mastering the skill of perfectly spacing letters in any kind of design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Upper and Lower Casing.</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine the impact a simple technique like the use of upper or lower case has on a design and yet some amateur designers completely overlook the importance of casing. Typography is completely dependent on the right use of the upper or lower case. It’s what makes or breaks a design, and if the designers have a knack for using the right case then their designs always stand out from the rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There you have it. The list of the best or most popular design techniques being used by designers these days.

<h1>Grid Free Designing</h1>
<p>Most designers are taught to follow a system of grids for designing to generate alignment and a proper structure. Have you ever thought of designing without grids? Many designers will say NO to this question.</p>
<p>The grid system actually bounds you into a confined structure that never let you to be creative. Grid-free designing is now getting popularity because customized designs can be generated with full freedom.</p>
<h2>Mixing Horizontal and vertical sliding</h2>
<p>Usually, the whole structure of the<a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/blog/45-horizontal-websites-showcase/"> website is vertical or horizontal.</a> The slides of images either go right to left or move up &amp; down. Playing with both x and y-axis at a time can also be a great idea. Though the execution of the design is a little bit difficult but a true artist knows how to handle that all.</p>
<p>It can be highly creative and attractive for fashionable products that some stuff is moving horizontally while some is moving up and down.</p>
<h2>Bright Colors</h2>
<p>Many times designers are afraid of using bright colors because they believe that sharp colors will give a harsh look to their design and the design may look cheap as well. Their thoughts are right to some extend but this issue can be catered by making hash colors complementing with other colors. Use of bright colors along with soft palettes can soothe the sharp effect of any color. You can also play with shades and tones to generate an appealing look of your design.</p>
<h2>Layout of Photos</h2>
<p>Usually designers layout their images into some patterns. This looks really organized and synchronized. But what if you place them without any layout. They will still look great and can spark up your design. Unorganized images can allow the human eye to stay more to figure out what is actually going within the design. They keep the curiosity factor alive in a design.</p>
<p>You can try these hacks for mockups or practice designing. The best way to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">explore new techniques</a> is to design and ask other people to rate your work. This can be great fun. You can understand the small clinches that become hindrances between you and creativity.</p>
