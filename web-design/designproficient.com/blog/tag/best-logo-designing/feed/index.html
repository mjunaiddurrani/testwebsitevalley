Web development is a complex technical field which requires every developer to keep learning new things to increase his proficiency and to hold a solid grasp of expertise in coding and programming websites.</p>
<p>Here are the three modern techniques every web developer should know about:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/08/30/ux-ui-design/">The Difference between UX and UI design</a></p>
<h1>CSS 3 media queries</h1>
<p>Css3 media queries are the fundamental building block elements of a <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">responsive website design</a>. These are syntax command code in a cascading style sheet module used to define set of parameters to modify the desktop screen resolution sizes and mobile browser viewport width.</p>
<p>The CSS3 media queries are used to apply styles with the CSS modules by using the @media and @import at-rules. It is also used to target specific media for the &lt;link&gt;, &lt;source&gt;, and other HTML elements. Moreover, it is further used to test media queries by using the Window.match media () and MediaQueryList.addlistener () JavaScript methods.</p>
<p>Following is the code to illustrate the CSS media queries with example:</p>
<p>@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {</p>
<p>#container {</p>
<p>Width: 320px;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Header h1#logo a {</p>
<p>Width: 320px;</p>
<p>Height: 44px;</p>
<p>Background: url (image-small.jpg) no-repeat 0 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Font resizing with REM</h1>
<p>Font resizing is a root element in Cascading style sheet to make it easier to increase and decrease the size of fonts by inches. It provides a relative measurement of length in the HTML element and defines in a percentage in the HTML body and h1 header tag.</p>
<p>Here is the font resizing code with root em:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Html {font-size: 62.5 %;}</p>
<p>Body {font-size: 1.4rem ;} /* =14px */</p>
<p>h1 {font-size: 2.4rem ;} /* =24px */</p>
<h1>Cache pages for offline usage</h1>
<p>Cache manifest is a new feature in the Html 5 web element which helps users to easily visit the website while being offline. It helps in navigating offline web pages with a faster loading speed and reduced load server.</p>
<p>Following is the code for offline cache pages:</p>
<p>Add-Type text/cache-manifest .manifest</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CACHE MANIFEST</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CACHE</p>
<p>index.html</p>
<p>style.css</p>
<p>image.jpg</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;html manifest=&#8221;/offline. Manifest&#8221;&gt;</p>

Go ahead:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/14/solve-5-biggest-problems-marketing/">How to Solve the 5 Biggest Problems with Marketing…….</a></p>
<h1><strong>1.  </strong><strong>Go With Plan </strong></h1>
<p>Always go with planning. Pre-planned things are more likely to succeed than unplanned things. Make sure you are planning each thing properly. How your logo should be, what customers will be its targeting, what message it will convey, how flexible it should be, and there are countless things need to be planned.</p>
<h2><strong>2.  </strong><strong>Don’t Fall For Premade Custom Logos, Hire an Expert</strong></h2>
<p>That’s completely fine if you know not much about logo designing since you are an entrepreneur, not a designer. There’s always a good alternative. Hire an expert designer who knows basic to advance principles of designs, color psychology, and possesses years of experience in the reputable organization.</p>
<p>Commonly, many people have been seen going for a premade logos. Premade or ready-made logos are not appropriate for your business. They are not unique and so should not be used.</p>
<h2><strong>3.  </strong><strong>Don’t Complicate, Make It Simple</strong></h2>
<p>Things if not simple, will sucks – to you and to your customers who are speculating on your logo and have lots of expectations from you. It is not good in any way to make them angry and confused. In fact, the purpose of the logo is to convey brand’s message. If they are multifaceted, they will not serve their primary goal.</p>
<h2><strong>4.  </strong><strong>Avoid Unnecessariness, Incorporate Only Needed Things</strong></h2>
<p>This point is an extension of them &#8211;. With simplicity, it meant to incorporate only things your logo needs or you think essential to add. Take a paper and pen out. Write about your business—what your business is about, who your customers are, what they do, and all. Write five two-three lines on each and then summarize. Hand over this summary to your designer and ask him to incorporate them as much as possible. Heavy ornaments, loud color tones, excessive text are the things can make your design meager.</p>
<h2><strong>5.  </strong><strong>Get Some Inspiration</strong></h2>
<p>The present market is overflowing with a number of good-to-inspire logo designs. Why not take some inspiration and take a hold of the good things from them? Research the market, get some good logo designs to see, study them and take inspiration for your coming business logo. By inspiration, it doesn’t mean to steal their work.</p>
<h2><strong><u>Last Thought</u></strong></h2>
<p>The logo is crucial for your business. Make it stand out and noticeable. Make your business well-known in the eyes of the public and get more sales. Directly or indirectly, it all starts with your logo, so don’t compromise with its eminence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether your business is about medicine, food, sport or anything else. It does not matter what the nature of your business is – it is crucial to design logos in timeless and memorable manner. <a href="https://www.bluesodapromo.com/blog/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-logo-design/">For designing a logo, it is important to understand certain things</a>. Every single line, shape, color, and form are important in making a conscious decision when it comes to design a logo for your business.</p>
<p>So, in this blog, I’ll talk about the important concept – a Figure-Ground relationship that will help you create a timeless business logo. Let’s look what it’s all about!</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/13/design-matters-rebrand-brand/">WHY DESIGN MATTERS FOR REBRAND YOUR BRAND</a></p>
<h1>SO, WHAT IS FIGURE-GROUND RELATIONSHIP IN CUSTOM LOGO FOR YOUR BUSINESS?</h1>
<p>Figure and ground are two terms with different meanings. The figure refers to the positive space in the logo design. Whereas, ground refers to the background or negative space in the emblem. Commonly, a logo is visually prevailing in the figure. Sometimes, the elements of the figure are ground dominating instead of being figure dominant.</p>
<h2>WHY THE CONCEPT IS IMPORTANT FOR CUSTOM LOGO DESIGNERS?</h2>
<p>When it comes to the importance of Figure-Ground relationship in logos, look Gestalt Principle. It will tell you that design is perceived as a unified whole. Figure-Ground Relationship is an extension of the Gestalt Principle.</p>
<p>When people view a logo, they see individual elements and categorize it in relationships. It means negative space is equally important as positive space because both spaces exist in relation and depend on each other.</p>
<h2>KINDS OF FIGURE GROUND RELATIONSHIPS:</h2>
<p>There are three types of figure-ground relationships. These are:</p>
<h2>1.    Constant Figure-Ground Relationship:</h2>
<p>This type allows a person to differentiate a ground and figure in the logo design easily. For making logo stable enough, the designer has to make one thing dominant over other. For instance, they can make negative space more prominent over positive space in the design.</p>
<h2>2.    Reversible Figure-Ground Relationship</h2>
<p>Both figure and the ground get equal attention in this type. In such design, there is space for the ground to take over the figure and for the figure to take over the ground. By doing so, it creates a sort of ambiguity.</p>
<h2>3.    Ambiguous Figure-Ground Relationship</h2>
<p>This type of relationship makes it quite difficult for spectators to separate ground from the figure in design. In such designs, viewers cannot detect a focal point. Although, it is ideal for creating patterns in the logo.</p>
<h2>HOW TO USE THE CONCEPT IN DESIGNING</h2>
<p>So, if you want to create distinct figure ground relationships in the logo, here is what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create stark figure-ground distinction by using contrasting colors. Using warm colors against a cool and cool against a warm background you can create a compelling contrast. This is especially helpful for users to recognize and read the text.</li>
<li>Make the ground non-existent in your logo, so that figure in design dominates the ground. You need to amplify and prominent the figure elements so that the ground becomes insignificant.</li>
<li>A blurred background acts well against a text. It is another way to make the figure-ground relationship blatant. In fact, it is a key technique in filmmaking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>END OF THE LINE</h2>
<p>So, these are the things you should consider about <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">making your business logo according to the figure-ground relationship concept</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The logo is a face of the brand that explains what your brand is. Designing a right logo can lead your business towards success. Logo designing is not an easy task; it requires strong research about the ongoing and even upcoming tends.</p>

<h1>Identify your brand</h1>
<p>The logo is an explanation of your business that should be potent enough to communicate with the targeted audience. Therefore, it should possess all the elements of the business that are mandatory to be delivered to the audience. List the things about your brand and especially its ideology. Link your ideologies with symbols and elements that best convey your brand`s message and use these elements smartly to create a logo. Be precise, use hidden clues and follow ‘less is more strategy’.</p>
<h2>Color’s psyche</h2>
<p>Remember your brand’s logo is not just a small colorful image. In fact, it involves a whole psyche of colors behind each element. Color psyche is vital to know in <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">logo designing</a>.  Some shades of colors are considered as harsh while some are cool. According to the color theory, the red color is considered as energetic while the orange shade produces friendly or youthful vibes. Yellow is used for cheerfulness, and the green color is for instructional purposes. The blue tones are used in professional or medical product logo.  Purple is for spirituality, black demonstrates power, white reflects simplicity, whereas pink color is commonly used in toys or other babies’ stuff. So try to opt the most appropriate color as per your business nature and customers psyche.</p>
<h2>Timelessness</h2>
<p>Timelessness matters a lot. Because you’re crafting a logo that will stay for years. So, try to come up with a design that is productive enough to interact with the people of not only today but tomorrow. Study deeply about the social transformations; how choices are changing, what are the values of people and other social trends. While studying the present design trends, try to predict the upcoming trends and make your logo accordingly.</p>
<h2>Thorough Research</h2>
<p>Research is mandatory in every aspect of designing to get success, including <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/02/the-ultimate-guide-to-logo-design/">logo designing.</a> Even the brands with the big name have their separate research team that is responsible for brief market trends, social aspects, market drifts, risk factors, etc. They study audience, their preferences, brand’s competitors, company’s long-term goals and every single aspect of the business that helps logo to stand out from the others.</p>
<p>Most of the start-up companies do not possess separate research panels for designing a logo.Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn`t. But it would be nearly impossible for the logo to fail to grab attention if all the aspects were thoroughly-researched.</p>
<h2>Simplicity and minimalism</h2>
<p>Try to keep logo as simple as possible because your logo will be used everywhere – from site to pamphlets or even from shoes to clothes. The heavy ornamentations, large fonts, clashing colors schemes can ruin your logo.</p>
<p>Consider popular logo designs too, and see how the simplicity works. One of the best examples of simplicity is NIKE, we all know how famous the logo is and how simple it is. It is a perfect example of minimalism approach while creating a logo. On the other hand, complicated logo designs are less likely preferable because complex logos are tough to identify. They are less memorable and less appealing.</p>
<p>Lastly, remember your logo is your brand’s identification. Follow mentioned tips to make a killer logo.</p>
