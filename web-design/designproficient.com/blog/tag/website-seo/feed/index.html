				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launching a website is the only half route towards online business, the other half is to bring potential customers to your website and stop the audience from driving away. Many small budget and simple sites can keep customers intact whereas many high budget websites are a total flop. The reason lies within the website design and development.</p>
<p>Here are six ways of driving customers away from a website and if your website is following any such pattern it’s time to change to earn more and more happy customers.</p>

<h1>URL is too complicated or misleading</h1>
<p>Complicated URLs never let the audience find your website while searching something of Google. URLs with numbers or tricky name, confusing spelling considered as least professional or tacky. Misleading URLs also play a role in confusing clients, and they don&#8217;t click BUY NOW button.</p>
<h1>Haphazard Landing Page</h1>
<p>Landing page with incorrect and unclear information is the biggest reason for leaving a website right ahead without checking out further information and company`s message. Landing page image and video are the two best chances to attract visitors and provoke them to visit service page or inventory of any website. When images are unorganized, information is not worthy, and the content is chaotic the visitors leave the site within 10 to 15 seconds.</p>
<h1>Pop-ups</h1>
<p>One or two pop-ups are fine, but too many pop-ups are exasperating and annoying. Useless and irrelevant pop-ups will drag the customer’s attention to something else, and many of them will shift to other <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">websites</a>.</p>
<h1>Grammar Errors in Content</h1>
<p>Grammar errors show the unprofessionalism and non-serious attitude of your company. Write simple and straightforward content with no grammar issues rather than finding quality in complex and long sentences.</p>
<h1>Complex Vocabulary</h1>
<p>No one will pay time to check for synonyms before placing an order on a website that’s why complex and rarely used vocabulary will only irritate people by not letting them understand your message. With poor message deliverance, the chances of getting good business are not possible.</p>
<h1>Auto-Music or Video</h1>
<p>Believe it or not auto music and video is a real pain. Firstly, out of nowhere something starts to play no matter you want to watch it or not. Secondly, it increases loading time, and in case of slow internet people can’t scroll or check other pages because of auto pay mode. Usually among multiple tabs, if something unnecessarily starts playing something people without giving a single look to website close that particular tab.</p>

<h1>1st tip# Create great content</h1>
<p>If you want to rank high in the search engine, then a high content can help you the most. Websites with a fresh, genuine and relevant content are more likely to get a chance to rank. Avoid grammatical mistakes and spelling lower. The question, how long the content should be? must be popping in your mind. Well, there’s no exact answer to it, but it should be at least not smaller than 500 words. In fact, for many, it is good minimum length for a typical blog post.</p>

It means, if you want to improve your ranking chances in the future with in-depth articles or blogs, you have to focus on both quality and quantity. The content must be excellent in quality, should be more than 2000 words.

<h2>4th tip# Page titles</h2>
<p>Your website’s page must possess compelling and relevant title with some keywords. The title should be descriptive enough to grasp by the readers about the content.

<p>If your website is selling a wide range of products and services, then must test whether this strategy is effective for making more sales or not. It has been found that proposing not more than two products in one place always translates into higher sales. Offering one product is ideal for one target market. And It is better to focus on one product and answers all the queries of your customers related to that product. Instead of trying to gratify your site visitors by giving them a large variety of products with less information about each service or product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>2.    Keep Up your website with Customers</h1>
<p>Do you know what’s more to focus on your website? It is your customers. <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/successful-sales-pages/">The most effective sales copy emphases on its customers or reader</a>.

See if it is filled with references to &#8220;I,&#8221; &#8220;me&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221;? It is always better to use “you” and “your” in content.  By so doing, you are assuring customer’s importance and making content customer-centric and increase sales on site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>3.    Search engines love Fresh web-content</h1>
<p>Fresh, good web content helps to gain trustworthiness, reliance and ultimately sales from the people who visit your website.

It must include your mission statement and possess relevant information about you and your services. The best web content should be user-centric. It should offer the information your visitors pursue and to present it in engaging and organized manner.</p>
<p>Here are some effective tips to help make your web content fresh and good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use conversational Language.</li>
<li>Use acquainted terminologies.</li>

<li>Clearly explain to your site visitors what you would like them to do next</li>
<li>Proofread your content. See, if it’s free from grammatical mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>4.    Get More Sales with Social Networking</h1>
<p>Having great content on website is good. But, it is not enough to produce high content and make the expectation that visitors find it – you have to control a whole situation rather than just responding to it after any mishap has happened. You have to get social to boost website traffic. Use different social media channels to promote your content. With 1.4 billion users, Facebook is ideal for interacting with customers. Twitter has more than 300 million, is renowned as a momentous brand awareness driving force. Pinterest is a giant in attracting predominantly female audiences. Instagram is popular among the young audience.</p>
<p>No matter what social media channel you’re opting for, your web content must always be geared toward reaching those visitors who can become potential customers or true fan.</p>
<h1>5.    SEO can never get old.</h1>
<p>The practice is valuable and worth more than before. There are two types of SEO: on-page and off-page. The techniques like creating internal links to your content, making the most of image alt text, giving importance to Meta descriptions are still considered as the backbone of On-page SEO. They help boost your organic traffic. On the other hand, off page SEO techniques can be used to improve the position of a website in the SERPs. The techniques include: Contribute as Guest Author, Forum submissions, Blog Directory Submission, Article Submission, Influencer Outreach and the list is endless.</p>
<h1>6.    Keywords still matter</h1>
<p>If you want more traffic, more leads, and better sales, then you’ll have to learn the proper use of keyword optimization to get more business. In keywords, you have two choices: Short-tail keywords and long-tail keywords. Short tail keywords are search watchwords with only one or two words. Long-tail keywords are broader, have three or more words.  Long tail keywords are more targeted and have significant search volume. Before going to actual keyword research, take some quality time to ask a few questions to yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is my audience?</li>
<li>Type of content my readers want to read</li>
<li>What should I offer as a solution for my customers?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also take help with keyword tools and get hundreds of keyword suggestions for your site, personalized to your industry and place.</p>
