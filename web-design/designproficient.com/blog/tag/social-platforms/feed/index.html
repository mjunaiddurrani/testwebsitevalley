<h1>Twitter</h1>
<p>The platform is full of interesting people, most of them are young. Today, the channel has more than 200 million active users. The 140 characters count of a tweet might be limited, but if it’s being used wisely, then it will payback you more than your thoughts. Twitter has its worth, importance to connect with people you want to interact with. And the good news is, once you get succeeded in gaining some popularity your account will take no time to go viral.</p>
<h1>YouTube</h1>
<p>YouTube is the most popular channel after Facebook. This video oriented site allows you create a Brand Account to give your business a YouTube presence of its own. With over 1 billion monthly visitors, it is the second largest search engine after Google. The YouTube market is competitive that invites engagement, sharing and theta users will enjoy.</p>
<p>Follow these three steps:</p>
<ul>

<li>Create a YouTube Brand Account</li>
<li>Add Managers to your YouTube Brand Account</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the best channel relevant to your business. Keep the niche of your business in front of your mind and pick the most productive one!</p>
<p><strong><em>So, here are some tips:</em></strong></p>
<p>Tip #1: Check out each channel, study them and find out the channel which will work more effectively for your business. Try to consider some of the factors with each channel: The product or service you are offering and the available resources at your disposal. Social media is free, but your time is precious enough to care.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Don’t use every channel or sign up on every platform for just because they’re new in the market or getting popular on the souk. Instead, find out the channel which is most relevant, effective to the business you’ve chosen to appeal your customers.</p>
<p>Tip #3: Before you’re going to decide which channel is more effective to work on, try to work out on a clear and implementable strategy. Many entrepreneurs or marketers lose their business focus while trying to be social. A play helps you actually to stay focused on a particular social channel.</p>
<p>Tip #4:  Everything takes time and might be some investment to show its benefits. Social media is no exception. So, if it’s taking some time, don’t get frustrated. Stick with your channel and strategy. It takes time and an investment of your time over a persistent period to achieve results.</p>
