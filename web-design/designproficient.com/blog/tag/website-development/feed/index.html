				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launching a website is the only half route towards online business, the other half is to bring potential customers to your website and stop the audience from driving away. Many small budget and simple sites can keep customers intact whereas many high budget websites are a total flop. The reason lies within the website design and development.</p>
<p>Here are six ways of driving customers away from a website and if your website is following any such pattern it’s time to change to earn more and more happy customers.</p>

<h1>URL is too complicated or misleading</h1>
<p>Complicated URLs never let the audience find your website while searching something of Google. URLs with numbers or tricky name, confusing spelling considered as least professional or tacky. Misleading URLs also play a role in confusing clients, and they don&#8217;t click BUY NOW button.</p>
<h1>Haphazard Landing Page</h1>
<p>Landing page with incorrect and unclear information is the biggest reason for leaving a website right ahead without checking out further information and company`s message. Landing page image and video are the two best chances to attract visitors and provoke them to visit service page or inventory of any website. When images are unorganized, information is not worthy, and the content is chaotic the visitors leave the site within 10 to 15 seconds.</p>
<h1>Pop-ups</h1>
<p>One or two pop-ups are fine, but too many pop-ups are exasperating and annoying. Useless and irrelevant pop-ups will drag the customer’s attention to something else, and many of them will shift to other <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">websites</a>.</p>
<h1>Grammar Errors in Content</h1>
<p>Grammar errors show the unprofessionalism and non-serious attitude of your company. Write simple and straightforward content with no grammar issues rather than finding quality in complex and long sentences.</p>
<h1>Complex Vocabulary</h1>
<p>No one will pay time to check for synonyms before placing an order on a website that’s why complex and rarely used vocabulary will only irritate people by not letting them understand your message. With poor message deliverance, the chances of getting good business are not possible.</p>
<h1>Auto-Music or Video</h1>
<p>Believe it or not auto music and video is a real pain. Firstly, out of nowhere something starts to play no matter you want to watch it or not. Secondly, it increases loading time, and in case of slow internet people can’t scroll or check other pages because of auto pay mode. Usually among multiple tabs, if something unnecessarily starts playing something people without giving a single look to website close that particular tab.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.webvanta.com/post/2014-08-04/10-tips-for-creating-websites-that-are-easy-to-maintain">Writing for a custom website is not a piece of cake</a>. If not done wisely, can ruin the complete persona of your website. No matter what and how your web design is making a striking impression by its appearance, the content writing is also worthy of remark. The content of your site should be readable, graspable and appealing to the readers. In this way, the conversational style works best. You have to destroy jargon, avid obscure acronyms, use active voice more, and set goals for your web content.</p>
<p>For your convenience, I’ve gathered some of the useful writing prescriptions for the web. So, scroll through:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/02/4-ways-developing-effective-brand-identity/">4 WAYS TO DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE BRAND IDENTITY</a></p>
<h1>1.    Start with setting the Tone</h1>
<p>There are two important things to give importance before explaining the appropriate tone of your site. Your target audience and what your website is aiming to achieve. So, start with asking &#8212; who’s your target audience? How old are they? Where they live? What values do they give importance to? Most importantly, what their preferences are? And about website, is it an e-commerce website? Is it about educational purpose?</p>
<p>Your audience and your professional website,<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web"> both are important when it comes to writing content on your site</a>. By knowing your audience precisely you may craft writing relevant to their interest in your site.</p>
<h1>2. Be professional AND human</h1>
<p>Try to avoid adding too much marketing jargon. By doing this, you are isolating yourself, as people don’t feel like they’re being sold. In this age, we are surrounded by a number of ads. Find out the appropriate way to present your business clearly, without losing your human face. Even, I also believe that people respond more quickly and better when they can see the professional man in front of him.</p>
<h1>3. Be concise</h1>
<p>You will be wonder to know that average attention span of a web user is not more than 7 seconds. By this, it meant that you have to make these limited time appealing enough to attract more eyeballs. It’s better to be creative and smart. But, everything is good if it remains in accord. Give your people the information they want before they lose their interest in your writing and head back to Google.</p>
<p>Being a writer, your aim should be and must be to avoid unnecessary or needless words in a sentence. Unnecessary words result in idleness.  You can achieve efficiency in your writing by using precise and concise words or phrases that denote some strong meaning and have power. The easy way to do so is to write everything you want and then eliminate those words from a context or sentence which you think are not contributing much. In other words, if a word can be eliminated from a text without affecting its meaning, it should be removed.</p>
<h1>4.    Use short words Use short sentences Use short paragraphs</h1>
<p>Do not go for long and complicated sentences. Shorter sentences are better than the longer ones. In fact, the short sentence is better because in this way there&#8217;s less risk of grammatical mistakes.</p>
<h1>5.    Focus on headlines</h1>
<p>Headling or titles that contain amazing adjectives are more likely to attract a lot more likes. On the other hand, if you see content with less-compelling headlines not get more clicks or retweets. So, try to incorporate highly-persuasive adjectives into your headlines.</p>
<p>So, these are some of the most important writing prescription for the web. I hope you like my blog!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">Everyone wants their website to be successful</a>. Unfortunately, most of us don’t know much about how to make a site stand out in the competitive market.</p>
<p>It is not only a good web-design but also usability that makes your site successful. But, sometimes we neglect the customers’ ease of use and give more importance to other things.</p>
<p>A successful website is one that gets popularity and provides you with significant ROI. It is not always about the design but about the mix of everything that is suitable according to your niche. As you have created the website for customers and users, so it is essential to make it appropriate for them. A user-friendly approach to designing, developments, sorting and content generation can play a vital role in creating a website accessible and popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, people when visiting your site shouldn’t be confused about a single element; whether it is about content, page-loading, navigation, color or anything on site. If visitors get confused or find any difficulty using your site, they leave, and your site will get a poor reputation.</p>
<p>So, if you have been struggling for the user-friendly website, then read mentioned information carefully and try to implement these as well.</p>

<h1></h1>
<h1>1.    MOBILE- FRIENDLY</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today’s world where mobile web browsing becomes more common than desktop. It becomes a necessity to create a mobile-friendly website.</p>
<p>It is a task of a designer to test his/her website both on desktop and mobile. There’re many testing tools available in the market that are considered handy for both newbies and experts.</p>
<p>W3C mobileOK Checker, iPhone, iPad Peek, Gomez, MobiReady, dotMobi Emulator are some of the several tools which allow you to check speed, accessibility and overall performance of the site.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h2>2.    FAST-LOADING</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a web designer or developer, you must know how important your site loading time is. If it takes more than 5 sec to load, then it won’t be considered as a user-friendly site. Moreover delay in page loading may not only affect website’s usability but also it&#8217;s ranking.</p>
<p>Avoiding the additional videos, images, and plugins on the site can work more than wonder for your site. Furthermore, I would also suggest you check your website speed with KeyCDN Speed Test, Pingdom, Gtmetrix or any reliable tool you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3.    CLEARLY-DEFINED AND ORGANIZED STRUCTURE</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the website looks unorganized or cluttered, then users may find hectic to get their required information from the site.</p>
<p>All you can do to make a site organized and synchronized for users are; make your website layout or design simple enough; always put organized or relevant content; add relevant or useful call-to-action to the site, follow a single theme for every page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.    CONSISTENCY</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The website you’re creating should be user-centric. In other words, it should be designed while keeping user’s behavior, choices, preferences, and their comfort in mind.</p>
<p>Users feel comfortable when they find each and everything consistent or relevant on site. It is your job to maintain consistency and familiarity with elements, design, typography, color, navigation on the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5.    VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a visual web design is another way to make your site user-friendly. Visual design is all about how you aesthetically bring color, images, typography and other elements together to improve the user`s experience.</p>
<p>Pulling all the website elements altogether also requires the wise use of white space, line, shapes and showing the hierarchy between different items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6.    STRONG MARKET RESEARCH</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strong market research is essential for creating a user-friendly website, with the help of which you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/55-ways-to-increase-engagement-with-your-target-audience/">Target customers that are relevant to your brand.</a></li>
<li>Consider approaches that can give you good Return on Investment.</li>
<li>Conduct prototype testing which will allow you to avoid future errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, there are many other elements you can go through to make your site more user-friendly. But the elements mentioned above are vital which you cannot ignore.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AMP refers to Accelerated Mobile Pages and its now being backed by Google as well. When we open a website on the desktop it loads comparatively faster than our cell phones. It is because your desktops have supportive programs. Also, RAM and memory are more than that of mobiles. Another factor is that processors of desktops are faster and efficient than mobiles. All these reasons not only affect the speed of loading of website but also disturbs the user experience.</p>
<p>According to Rudy Galfi, AMP’s project PM affirms</p>
<p><em>“The median load time for AMP is 0.7 seconds, the time it takes for your eye to blink twice. By contrast, the median load time for non-AMPs is 22.0 seconds, the time it takes for you to leave the site and never come back.”</em></p>
<p>Here are some benefits of AMPs and how they can affect the commercial world.</p>

<h1>More views more customers</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">When a website takes too long to load</a>, viewers mostly switch the page off and go for some other options. No one likes o wait. AMP allows the website to load almost four times faster. More people can view your website easily. More views eventually help companies to have more customers.</p>
<h1>Efficient system</h1>
<p>AMP technology is efficient in many ways. It allows videos, pictures and sound clips to load faster and improves data consumption system. It also helps users to view more in less time. Speed efficiency enables clients to view videos which they usually use to skip because of long and protracted buffering time.</p>
<h1>Better Ranking</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3091071/search/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-google-amp.html">Google recognizes AMP websites more valuable for the users</a>. Google mark AMP websites and their placement rankings get improved. Convalescent content distribution and top rankings on Google allow website owners to expand their business quickly and efficiently.</p>
<h1>Standard for Publishers</h1>
<p>Accelerated Mobile Pages is an open-source coding standard for publishers. AMP forces you to use a streamlined version of CSS also it doesn’t allow Javascript. You are provided with an off-the-shelf Javascript, you can use features from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
