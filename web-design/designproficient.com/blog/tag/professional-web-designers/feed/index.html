				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">Responsive design is becoming a need for a professional web deSignagency</a>. Because, it can solve a lot of problems – will improve the way your website looks on devices, make your site user-friendly, and make the users spend more time on website. In fact, it can help you improve your site ranking in search engines. Unfortunately, most of the brands don’t know that more than half of the users on a website are from mobile. However, the percentage of mobile users will continue to grow in coming few years. If your company’s website is not responsive, then here are few best practices you can do to make it responsive for both- desktop and mobile users.</p>
<p>Here is the list of things you can do to make responsive professional website:</p>

<h1>ADAPTABLE ON ALL DEVICES</h1>
<p>Responsive design is something that fits on all type of the devices: desktop, mobile, and tablet. One can deliver a great experience through it. I already mentioned that mobile responsiveness is essential ranking factor. In fact, it is a first step in creating a responsive web page that fulfils the demands of its users. For true responsive design, every element of a website’s markup should be context-aware and balance with the screen.</p>
<h2>INTUITIVE NAVIGATION</h2>
<p>Intuitive navigation is another critical website element to have a responsive and successful website. It means that your site is created in such a way that website traffic streams from web page to web page. On the other hand, website with a poor user experience will undergo from high rates of leaving.</p>
<h2>CONSISTENCY</h2>
<p>Well-Build navigation is not enough. Design consistency is extremely important. Add consistent elements with clear in goals. Try to know about your audience and their expectations. If you know what users expect to do on your site, then you can design for those prospects. Also, keep pages similar, usable and stay consistent with design and content of your website.</p>
<h2>BOLD TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.webydo.com/blog/graphic-design/typography/11-stunning-typography-examples-from-3-surprising-sources/">Typography is a huge topic when it comes to design a responsive website.</a> Being a designer, it’s your responsibility to know for whom you are designing. If you fail to deliver readable text, you’ll end up with poorly designed website. It is crucial to understand the nature of devices, check which typeface is more suitable for a particular device, and check the distance from which your audience will look at displays. Make sure the letters should be stand out from the background. Also, create a visual rhythm of each element with the wise use of a grid.</p>
<h2>USE OF MICRO INTERACTIONS IN WEBSITE</h2>
<p>The use of micro-interactions is one of the most common things web designer thinking as a trend. Micro-interactions are variables that allow a visitor to interact with a website without reloading it. In fact, they’re the fundamental part of website design, that any site without them will probably look bland and uninteresting. Micro-interactions make the user experience much more fun and also save time.</p>
<p>Consider these practices and make your custom website responsive enough to attract more customers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Created website by putting all efforts, without taking much care about website’s metrics, is just like walking down a dark cave and assuming someone will torch a light for you.</p>
<p>Metrics are numbers that state accurate measurement and provide a base to suggest enhancements. Considering one measurement is not enough to measure the effectiveness of your website. Both operational and financial metrics are commonly used to track and assess the status of a specific process.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.spinweb.net/steps-to-audit-your-website-and-present-your-findings">Most of the professional web designers find difficult to choose right metric.</a> For convenience, I’ve compiled some of the well-known metrics helpful for your website:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/06/market-self-social-media-6-steps/">How to Market Your Self on Social Media in 6 Steps</a></p>
<h1>1.    Number of Website Visitors</h1>
<p>It is crucial to possess reliable source to track incoming traffic on your custom website. For the respective purpose, there’re three primary sources or three type of website visitors. The one who enters directly into your site by typing URL in browser address. The one who enters your site based on the search request. The last ones are the referral visitors. All three sources have a different level of conversion, and you should calculate traffic of each.</p>
<h1>2.    Bounce Rate</h1>
<p>In internet marketing, bounce rate refers to the measurement of people entering your website without going to any other webpage. Simply put, it is just like a single-page session that generates only a single request to the analytics server. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Low bounce rate means that visitors’ engagement is good on your site.</a> On the contrary, high bounce rate is an indicator of a bad situation.</p>
<h1>3.    Exit Pages</h1>
<p>Most of the visitors often get confused between “bounce” and “exit.”  Both are different metrics to measure. Unlike a “bounce,” when a site visitors enter to your site and hardly views one page, an “exit” is when a user enters and visits a number of pages and then abandon your site. If your website has a high exit rate, it has some problem. Knowing the exit rates and reasons one can improve site traffic and so conversion.</p>
<h1>4.    Crawl Errors</h1>
<p>Besides the metrics mentioned above, Google Search Console displays you crawl errors. It is pointless to say that, any crawl error on the website should be addressed soon, having crawl errors on site is as just your website does not work as they are supposed to and doesn’t bring you any conversion. It is imperative to check crawl errors report once a week and deal with what you find. High crawl errors mean that your site is either down or misconfigured. Low crawl errors is a temporary condition and also indicate your improper site configuration.</p>
<h1>5.    Final Conversions</h1>
<p>To know how well your strategy is working you need to know about final conversions. It is a metric and very simple to achieve. It is an achievement of the end goal you set in front of your business. Final conversion is the only metric that allows you if you should change anything on your website.</p>
<p>Though there are numerous other subtle metrics, but metrics mentioned above, are enough to make or destroy your professional website.</p>
