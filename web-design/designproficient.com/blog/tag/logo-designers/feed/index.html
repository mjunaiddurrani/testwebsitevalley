				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The logo is a face of the brand that explains what your brand is. Designing a right logo can lead your business towards success. Logo designing is not an easy task; it requires strong research about the ongoing and even upcoming tends.</p>
<p>Following are the five essential tips to know for crafting a killer logo:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/02/27/8-effective-seo-tips-rank-beginner-website/">8 effective SEO tips to rank beginner website</a></p>
<h1>Identify your brand</h1>
<p>The logo is an explanation of your business that should be potent enough to communicate with the targeted audience. Therefore, it should possess all the elements of the business that are mandatory to be delivered to the audience. List the things about your brand and especially its ideology. Link your ideologies with symbols and elements that best convey your brand`s message and use these elements smartly to create a logo. Be precise, use hidden clues and follow ‘less is more strategy’.</p>
<h2>Color’s psyche</h2>
<p>Remember your brand’s logo is not just a small colorful image. In fact, it involves a whole psyche of colors behind each element. Color psyche is vital to know in <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">logo designing</a>.  Some shades of colors are considered as harsh while some are cool. According to the color theory, the red color is considered as energetic while the orange shade produces friendly or youthful vibes. Yellow is used for cheerfulness, and the green color is for instructional purposes. The blue tones are used in professional or medical product logo.  Purple is for spirituality, black demonstrates power, white reflects simplicity, whereas pink color is commonly used in toys or other babies’ stuff. So try to opt the most appropriate color as per your business nature and customers psyche.</p>
<h2>Timelessness</h2>
<p>Timelessness matters a lot. Because you’re crafting a logo that will stay for years. So, try to come up with a design that is productive enough to interact with the people of not only today but tomorrow. Study deeply about the social transformations; how choices are changing, what are the values of people and other social trends. While studying the present design trends, try to predict the upcoming trends and make your logo accordingly.</p>
<h2>Thorough Research</h2>
<p>Research is mandatory in every aspect of designing to get success, including <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/02/the-ultimate-guide-to-logo-design/">logo designing.</a> Even the brands with the big name have their separate research team that is responsible for brief market trends, social aspects, market drifts, risk factors, etc. They study audience, their preferences, brand’s competitors, company’s long-term goals and every single aspect of the business that helps logo to stand out from the others.</p>
<p>Most of the start-up companies do not possess separate research panels for designing a logo.Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn`t. But it would be nearly impossible for the logo to fail to grab attention if all the aspects were thoroughly-researched.</p>
<h2>Simplicity and minimalism</h2>
<p>Try to keep logo as simple as possible because your logo will be used everywhere – from site to pamphlets or even from shoes to clothes. The heavy ornamentations, large fonts, clashing colors schemes can ruin your logo.</p>
<p>Consider popular logo designs too, and see how the simplicity works. One of the best examples of simplicity is NIKE, we all know how famous the logo is and how simple it is. It is a perfect example of minimalism approach while creating a logo. On the other hand, complicated logo designs are less likely preferable because complex logos are tough to identify. They are less memorable and less appealing.</p>
<p>Lastly, remember your logo is your brand’s identification. Follow mentioned tips to make a killer logo.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever laid your eyes on a logo that’s just plain bad? I bet you have. It seems like a terrible thing to say, but it’s a fact that the increase in bad logo designs are increasing. Laymen or design professionals, no matter who you are, some logos are just too hard to like. Some people actually consider a bad logo to be a reflection of ‘brand weakness’. Believe it or not, these ‘people’ happen to be some of the best design professionals in the world.</p>
<p>So, if you’re a logo designer or maybe a logo design company that designed a bad logo, does that make you a bad design professional/agency? The answer is no. Even the best of us make mistakes. However, these mistakes come back to haunt you heavily when the time comes. Why wait for a career suicide when you can work on the red flags and turn them green?</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’ll be discussing some of the most prominent mistakes that logo designers make frequently. So without running around in circles, let’s jump right into it.</p>
<h2><strong>A Very Busy Logo Design</strong></h2>
<p>This is perhaps one of the biggest mistakes that I’ve seen over the years. In fact, I’ve seen esteemed experts in the design industry such as Jason Li, Co-Founder of Tum Yum DeSignagency discuss this problem in the past as well. You can have a look at his blog <a href="https://medium.com/tomyum/logo-design-af5080273895">here</a>.</p>

<p>A busy logo is always going to get a bad impression from the targeted audience. If there’s too much going on in the logo design, your potential custom won’t know where to pay attention. One of the many reasons why minimal design is progressing in general. There’s always one ‘sweet spot’ in your logo that really is key in creating results. When there’s too much happening in the logo, you won’t really get the chance to impress your customer. Of course, elements are important to your logo, but make sure the design in the perfect flow. Focus on not overcrowding the logo with unnecessary elements. In most cases, one single element is enough to do the trick.</p>

<h2><strong>Poor Focus on Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>This mistake is one of the most repetitive mistakes that I’ve seen happen. This even happens to the biggest of brands. As a logo designer and/or as a logo deSignagency, you need to realize that the logo isn’t solely visible on one placement. From social media display pictures to business cards, the brand identity needs to customize itself. A huge part of the brand identity is the logo design itself and that’s where things get rough.</p>

<p>Thorough research on the logo design placements is very important. As a design professional, you need to have a list of placements lined up to offer the client. You can also include this as a question in your design brief. Most of the times, clients aren’t well aware of brand identity. As a logo design professional, it is your duty to not only educate the client but assist them as well.</p>
<h2><strong>A Victim to Cliché </strong></h2>
<p>Now, this is one mistake that sometimes rattles up a lot of logo designers and even logo design companies. From the sparks, to the bevels and even the swooshes, there are several cliché design trends that are overused in the industry.</p>

<p>What confuses graphic designers around the world is that at one hand people endorse design trends and at the other, hate them in general. Well, it’s simple. There are several areas where design trends actually work. Logo Design isn’t one of them. A notable example is Material Design that is being followed by designers worldwide for app and web design. On the contrary, it can’t be used in the field of logo design. Logos define individuality and if there’s even a small similarity between two logos, the logo isn’t worth it. To avoid this mistake, research is key. Make the most out of your research and your logo design will almost always be a masterpiece with its standalone brilliance.</p>
<p>All in all, these are three of the biggest mistakes that are consistently invading the logo design industry. Your logo is vital for your business, regardless of your industry. Focus on your brand’s identity and it will change the way your customers react to your business in general. A rookie mistake can ruin your business completely and that’s not a chance that you should take. For excellent logo design services, consider The Web Founders.
