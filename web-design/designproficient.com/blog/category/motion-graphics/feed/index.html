				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s world it is no longer a wonder that more than 70% of businesses possess online existence in the face of websites. Unfortunately, only few of them know the importance of making a website search engine friendly.</p>
<p>What does SEO friendly website really mean? Simply it is a website that is easy to read and understand by the search engines. <a href="https://kcwebdesigner.com/seo-friendly-website-design/">SEO friendly website is actually a visitor friendly website.</a></p>
<p>Some of the important characteristics of SEO friendly websites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be responsive</li>
<li>To be not too fussy or ornate to read</li>
<li>Should be User-friendly</li>
<li>Should be mobile-responsive</li>
<li>Should possess optimized images with the text</li>
<li>Having clear hierarchy and text-based Navigation Structure</li>
</ul>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/04/2-ways-voice-search-turn-seo-brain/">2 Ways Voice Search Turn Your SEO on its Brain</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong>Responsiveness</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Responsiveness is a key to make your web page look appealing on all browsers and devices- desktop, mobile phone, and, tablet. Responsive design has three principles to be executed to work properly: Fluid grids, Media queries, and flexible images. To be responsive actually means to be adaptable.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong>Optimizing Images</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Another way to make your site SEO friendly is to optimize images with texts.</a> Just name your images descriptively, optimize your alt attributes, choose image dimensions, optimize thumbnails, use image sitemaps and test your images.</p>
<p>In fact, there’re many compression tools available that make the art of image optimization possible. ImageRecycle, OptimiZilla, Tinypng, giftofspeed, and kraken are some of the examples to compress multiple images or files in one go.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>Videos and Infographics</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Info graphics are  a visual representation of data beneficial to the website. Because more than 85% of information transmitted to brain is visual.</p>
<p>The act of embedding videos to the website is best way to get your message across. By putting interactive and interesting videos you can get heavy traffic on your site. As 44% of Google search results feature video.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong>Great UX Leads to High Ranking</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Users are prior and good user experience help your site to convert more. If users coming your site find any distractions and difficulty, they’ll abandon. On the other hand, site having appealing look, intuitiveness, easy to navigate with clear instructions get more chance to engage users.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2><strong>Make your URL’s User Friendly</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is not only your responsive web layout or good content but also URL that should be user friendly. It is easy to read and understand. User friendly URL help people to remember the web address, increase click through rate and even influence social metrics.</p>
<p>Just keep it short, use relevant keywords, use real words, be descriptive, and not to prefer using tracking parameters.</p>
<p>At the end, these five elements are enough to make your site SEO friendly. But there are many other things you can do, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporating social media elements into your website</li>
<li>Add 2-5 relevant keywords to the single web page</li>
<li>Use JavaScript in restricted manner, do not use it for whole site design</li>
<li>Do not use too much flashy elements, it can be distracting</li>
<li>Create page hierarchy properly</li>
<li>Write unique titles and meta descriptions</li>
<li>Reduce Code bloat, HTML table Usage</li>
<li>Lessen the number of on-page links</li>
<li>Implement proper heading tag and structured data</li>
<li>Use properly Coded lists</li>
<li>Keep an eye on your security certificate renewals</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web designer must not forget that they have 10 seconds or even less to grab the visitors’ attention on the site. That means they have no chance to make any mistakes while making web designs.</p>
<p>The nonfunctional website is a big headache which is an outcome of our own mistakes. One can deal with it by ignoring the below-mentioned blunders while creating a web design:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/03/16/5-instagram-features-business-2018/">5 INSTAGRAM FEATURES FOR BUSINESS IN 2018</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong> Making Your Site Overloaded</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Heavy content or adding unnecessary things like excessive pop-ups, advertisements, plug-ins, and visuals can give your site a messy look. In fact, these things would be damaging for your site. Try to do performance/stress testing of your existing site and check if it’s free from load.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong> Not Mobile-Friendly</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to the perfect site, it is not an easy task. It should be both &#8212; desktop and mobile friendly. Unfortunately, most of the designers do not know that more than 40% of sales happen on mobile. And if people cannot approach your site via mobile than it’ll lose a big chance of traffic, ROI or sales. So check out if your site is handy for mobile or tablet users by testing it on suitable mobile-responsive checker tool.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong> Using Inappropriate Typography</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The use of inappropriate typefaces or unreadable fonts (use of too large or too small fonts) on the website is the not-to-do thing that we commonly do.</p>
<p>It is your task to offer people a website which has readable content. Use appropriate font size. Use bright colors against the light background and light colors against dark colored-background.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong> Avoid Simplicity </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Making things overcomplicated on site is another mistake most of us do, that should be sidestepped. With simple layouts, illustration, and the familiar language you can make things easy-to-understand and simple for your customers.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2><strong> Poor Navigating System</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The site built with the strong navigating system is considered as successful. On the other hand, if people find difficulty in searching or getting their required information, they will abandon the site.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.netguru.co/blog/10-ux-tips-to-improve-website-navigation">Creating a navigating system on your site is not enough</a>. Rather one has to maintain its performance. Poorly built navigation bar can make things horrible for your visitors and so for you.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2><strong> Adding Excessive Backlinks</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Adding Backlinks is useful but too many links on your webpage is against strong <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">UI/UX design</a> canon. Excessive backlinks can distract readers to engage with your website. Unfortunately, I’ve seen many people doing this. I would suggest not to add more than two backlinks in a single web page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h2><strong> Ignore Headings- H1 and H2</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the designers ignore the importance of headings and emphasis more on the content; it is UX killer. Remember more than 80% of visitors read the headings of your site and judge content. Aappealing headlines can give you a better chance of higher viewership. The site should possess clear, indulging headings and subheadings through which website can rank.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h2><strong> Having No or Unclear Key Information </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Who are you? What services you’re offering? How you deliver them? How people can contact you?  These are some of the things your visitors may want to know immediately after landing on your website. Unfortunately, most of us missed these things to mention clearly in sites and got poor outcomes in the face of low traffic or sales.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h2><strong> Putting Irrelevant or Less Interactive Visuals</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Images and videos could be more interactive than those wordy texts written on your site if they&#8217;re being used wisely. Most of us, sometimes, emphasizing more on the text do not give importance to the relevancy of the visuals. Remember poor selection of visuals can ruin the overall website design.</p>
<p>So, these are the common but serious mistakes we often use to do while designing. Hopefully you have found these things helpful enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The history of animation is linked to ancient Egyptian era, people of that times used to carve sculptures that repeat their motions in a specific pattern. The technique at that time used to be considered as some spiritual power is making the idol to move. Spinning wheels were also used to create the ambiance of motion of objects creating some certain moves.</p>
<p>The idea, later on, was adopted by illustrator and sketchers to create a series of pictures. These pictures were created and places in a way that when compiled and played speedily, they seem to create an animation.</p>

<h1>2D Animation</h1>
<p>Though technology is spreading its wings day by day and in the market even 6D animation videos are being created by several companies still the demand for 2D animation is high. Many companies prefer to place a<a href="https://marionettestudio.com/how-animation-and-graphics-are-changing-the-entire-marketing-world-2/"> 2D animation video</a> on landing pages of their website along with social media pages to provide an explanation about the features, uses and working of their products. The reason is that 2D animation production consumes less time and is cost-effective.</p>
<p>Another reason to prefer 2D animation video is that their production doesn`t require exceptional or very advanced technology. The software’s of 2D animation can efficiently function on even windows 7. So it`s quite simple to produce 2D animation, and yet it benefits marketing brand a lot. For products and services that are common, simple and a necessity, 2D animation videos are ideal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3D Animation</h2>
<p>For luxury products, fashion or design related products and services and <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">digital marketing</a> firms’ 3D animation videos are a potent tool to generate a brand`s impact on the customers. It helps to convert potential clients into regular buyers. 3D animation videos are more realistic than 2D animation videos, and their influence is thrice attractive as well. Apparently, to generate a 3D animation video, you need a reasonable budget. The production of 3D animation is expensive and consumes more time.</p>
<p>The complex and multi-functional products are best explained through 3D animation because all the sides and aspects of products are defined well, and viewers can experience a more realistic perspective of the products.

Characters make the product and script of video interesting. Also, they play a role in crafting a creative impact regarding the brand.</p>
<h2><u>Background Illustrations</u></h2>

For a genuine appearance of your product, backgrounds are the energizing element. They enhance the look of the product, helps in creating a niche in viewer`s mind and promotes the desire for that product.</p>
<h2><u>Theme Base</u></h2>

The concept of following single theme is loved by the audience because it makes them understand the website navigation system and the concept of product easily. The theme also gives a great visual appeal. It is a safe play for designers because with very less effort they can create synchronization between several elements of design.</p>
<h2><u>Scripting</u></h2>
<p>Obviously, a <a href="https://www.videobrewery.com/blog/how-to-write-a-killer-explainer-video-script/">video is incomplete without a script</a>. A proper script is the backbone of animated videos. The conversational tone of the script is very catchy for the viewers. Tailor your script in a way that you or your character is directly talking to the viewers. Manage some words to define the background of your product/services/ business concept. This small alteration in your script can add life to your animated video.</p>

<p>Minimalism means adding only necessary elements and cut off from extra ornamentation in your designing or concept. The theory of minimalism allows video directors to add necessary point in less time frame. <a href="https://wistia.com/blog/optimal-video-length">Short videos are more ideal</a> and to keep them short yet productive minimalism idea is very suitable.

Your first draft of design should be relentlessly creative and based entirely on imagination without technical concerns. Develop the mock-up in Photoshop first and then dig into coding it.</p>

<h2>Banner Slideshow Won’t Work</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The trend of slideshow/image carousel previously became very popular but it doesn’t seem to outshine anymore. This layout is although inclusive in terms of information but with escalating competition in the web market, the user hardly stays that long to go through all banners. Be more particular and well-defined. Decide one prominent feature of your product and present it in the most appealing style.</p>

<h2>Use Simpler Navigation</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We have come a long way beyond all those traditional headers or sidebars flooded with links and tabs.<a href="http://brolik.com/blog/simplify-navigation-better-usability-2/"> Simplify the navigation</a> by reducing the links. Avoid using dropdown and multi-tier menus as they often overwhelm the users.</p>

<h2>Slide Away Social Media Icons</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The important information about your product should take the most prominent place on your webpage, not the social media icons. Placing these icons on header would be an unwise thing to do as you will invite users to leave just before they fully arrive. Place the icons in the footer and let users connect with your product first and then move further to find out more.</p>

<h2>Make Font Size Bigger and Colors Bolder</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In web design, typography and colors are incredibly important as they draw most of the attention of the user. Make your font stand out and clearly visible by increasing its size. Take inspiration from the beauty of nature and extract vibrant and contrasting palette of colors for your web landscape.</p>
<p>Now you know the drill and technique to play with your creativity. Just go ahead and create wonders.</p>
