				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Explainer Video with its Subtlety</strong></h1>
<p>Going by the definition, an explainer video is essentially a brief video clip that acts as an explanatory tool for the viewers to digest the presented information more effectively &amp; timely. These explainer videos for business are meant to disperse information ranging from basic company features to advance product(s) and/or service(s) descriptions, all aimed at enamoring clients as well as visitors. Successful explainer videos for business necessarily accommodate certain general traits that make them recognizable &amp; acceptable among users such as understandable commentary, simple illustrations, discreet invitations and step-by-step guidance towards the usage of your web portal.</p>
<h2><strong>Rein in Your Explainer Video Cost:</strong></h2>
<p>Putting it in apt terms, the budget of an explainer video can be as varied as there are developed videos; it all comes down to your level of expertise employed while creating one. While you intend to “play” straight &amp; level, you would come to appreciate the fact that explainer videos can be had as multiple forms which are &amp; not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Explainer Video</li>
<li>Animated Video for Business</li>
<li>3D Explainer Video</li>
<li>Custom Explainer Video</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/10/26/material-minimal-2d-custom-explainer-videos-work/">How Material and Minimal 2D custom explainer videos can work for your business</a></strong></p>
<p>When attempted the right manner, an <a href="https://www.videobrewery.com/blog/10-reasons-why-your-business-needs-an-explainer-video/">explainer video can transform itself into a magical show</a> for your business. It puts a great show by being cost effective, lively &amp; “explosive” to your audience. As afore-stated, each category of the explainer video is tagged at a different price owing to varied requirements of skill level, time, script, voice-over artists and of course, animators. To hint at an expense figure without much precision, it can only be regarded lying between £1,000 &amp; £15,000 (or even higher!). So, when it comes to deciding your illustrator &amp; assigning him the task, the end cost should be weighed against the availed benefits to fetch in some sort balance between the two.</p>
<p>Whatever the type, any business would prefer an affordable explainer video featuring maximum goodness and yielding enviable profits. Each step that goes into crafting a video falling under a certain category carries its own price tag. Beginning with the 1<sup>st</sup> stage and marching along all the way till its terminal phase, the price slot as well would generally show a rising gradation in values. This step-by-step breakup of the expense actually appears to be beneficial to the entrepreneur, letting him some respite from an otherwise substantial expenditure incurring at one go.</p>
<p>You should keep to the fact the first impression goes as your last impression. Trainer or explainer video production that is targeted towards a particular goal is more likely going to be a one-time expense. To milk your all-essential clip to the fullest, it is a good bit of idea not to throttle this initial, crucial expense by downsizing its budget.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is undoubtedly the first way to interact with your customers these days. From Facebook to Instagram, from Snapchat to Twitter, there are several different social media websites where you can easily coordinate with your loved ones. Well, so do your customers. Your customers are present on any and every social media outlet there is. Well, when there’s audience on social media; so are brands.</p>
<p>For smaller brands, becoming the next big thing on social media is perhaps very easy and important as it can possibly be. It might sound very easy, but it’s very strategic and an important part will be played by the social media post designs. Most brands really don’t realize what they have to keep in mind with social media designs which is why we’re here to help.</p>
<h2><strong>Focus On The Agenda</strong></h2>
<p>Always make sure that the agenda of the social post is expressed beautifully through the designs. The design is undoubtedly one of the best things that you can work with. Never be blunt with your agenda in your social media designs. Express it in a subtle manner, make it the best that it can be. If you love aesthetics, play with it aesthetically. You should always love the way you work with your designs. If you don’t love and express your agenda via designs, it won’t really work for you either.</p>
<h2><strong>Include Your CTAs</strong></h2>
<p>Your CTAs or your call-to-action buttons won’t really seem like its important but without it you won’t be expecting any conversions either. Providing information to your customer is a great way to go but not informing them about the CTAs is a stupid decision. Here’s the thing, you have around a 5 second window to engage your customer and if your design doesn’t have a CTA, you won’t really be able to convert at all.</p>
<p>All in all, social designs are pretty important to work on if you’re searching for conversion based results. If there’s something that you want to add, you can easily do that without a problem by adding a comment below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been a constant reader of our blog, you already know how important a brand is to the company. However, what you probably don’t realize as a beginner is that there are several different types of brands out there each portraying a different identity. Your brand is nothing but a persona built to interact with your customers representing your company. Let us elaborate further on what your brand strategy is.</p>
<h1><strong>Understanding Brand Strategy</strong></h1>
<p>Understanding and choosing your brand strategy is perhaps the biggest step that you’ll take to create an everlasting brand. There are several steps that you need to take to create the perfect brand strategy. In this blog we’ll be taking you step by step and will be helping you understand just how great your brand can become. So, without further ado, let’s start from the basics.</p>
<h2><strong>Identify your brand purpose</strong></h2>
<p>Without a doubt, each brand is made up of several elements and the base of these messages is the purpose of the brand. What does your brand stand for? What’s the main ideology behind your brand? What was the idea behind your existence? There are several questions similar to these that can identify the purpose of your brand. Keep that in mind each time you set out to work on your brand.</p>
<h2><strong>Have a look your audience</strong></h2>
<p>Think about what your audience stands for. Understand what your audience is like. The more you analyze your audience, the better you’re going to present them the brand you own. Coca Cola is a great example of a brand that connects to its users in every way possible. The best and most recent example is the open happiness campaign that they own.</p>
<p>All in all, the best brands know the strategy solely by knowing how they wish to express themselves. The best brands are the ones that make their mark on the customer with their strategy for good. Think we missed out on something? No problem! Tell is what we missed out on in the comments section and we’ll add it in</p>
