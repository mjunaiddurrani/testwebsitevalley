<p>We all are aware of WhatsApp messenger. If we will say that WhatsApp is the most significant source for text and voice messages, then it wouldn’t be wrong. Over millions of people use WhatsApp daily to connect to their relatives and friends. They do voice calls, video calls, group video calls, and many more. It is the most secure communication app.</p>
<p>Many updates have been made to WhatsApp since it was introduced. It has a really funky and unique chats default wallpaper. The update that made people a little bit annoying when the update changed ‘WhatsApp status’ as ‘Bio’ and allow people to share their pictures under ‘Status’ tag. But later, the audience gets comfortable with it.</p>
<p>WhatsApp was first introduced in 2009, and as of now, it has a vast number of users that are almost 2.00 Billion.</p>

<h1>Determine the Company’s Marketing Goals</h1>
<p>Even though this might sound a little cliché, but it is advised that you “Plan your work, and work your plan.” Developing a strategic plan is going to help your organization go a long way towards getting off to a very good start. When you are determining the marketing goals, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What new products and/or services will I be launching this year?</li>
<li>What is the overall revenue goal for this year?</li>
<li>What key metrics are extremely important when it comes to measuring my sales and marketing success?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Reduce Your Expenses</h1>
<p>One of the tried and tested ways using which you can bring up your sales is by reducing your expenses. For examples, you may want to consider having shared offices instead of having your own expansive and expensive space. Keep a track of your account books and identify where your money is going. After analyzing this, look for various different ways to reduce all the expenses incurred without actually compromising the business.</p>
<h1>Improve Your Customer Relationship</h1>
<p>You should also be active when it comes to improving your relationship with your clients. Focus on initiating loyalty. When consumers are loyal, you can trust that they will support your products, even when you increase prices, given that the quality remains top-notch. Research about your clients, think about customer segmentation, learn about what they need, and design approaches that will allow you to deliver a high level of consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is very easy to be overwhelmed when it comes to considering all the various different marketing choices and paths accessible to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">grow your business</a>. Nonetheless, with all signs pointing towards constant economic growth worldwide in the year 2018, there is still time to create a plan to increase revenue this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No need to mention that if you are running any business, you have to face new challenges to your business and customers. The common problems could be: lacking website traffic, lacking users’ interests, sales funnel deficit, and deprived lead conversion. It is sad to deal with such issues after spending much time, money and considerations to the business.</p>
<p>The good news is that the use of several marketing tactics can help you solve these problems across the board. With its flexibility helps you <a href="https://www.intechnic.com/blog/how-to-set-smart-business-goals-for-a-business-website/">make improvements and reach the goals that you have set earlier for your business</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dig more in-depth at the common business problems and how marketing can play a significant role in problem-solving.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/12/5-unsung-myths-marketing/">5 UNSUNG MYTHS ABOUT MARKETING</a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Content Marketing Campaign</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fresh, new, genuine content is like a fuel for your business. It can work to resolve many of the issues that your business is facing and presents you with a chance to position your business in the center of your target audience. If the content is compelling, interesting and on the recent topics, it can earn more attention. The user-centric is the only things which you cannot take as an optional. Write a genuine and fresh blog or web content relevant to your business. Make your content highly-relevant to your potential readers’ preferences. Understand their opinions and think about their likes and dislikes before writing any content. The headlines and titles get more attention and require more consideration.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Properly Optimized Web Content</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After preparing the content, get all your attention towards optimization. Proper optimization is a need. Incorporate relevant keywords into the content. Here, you cannot go recklessly. You have to be very wise and responsible about what keywords should be added on a content. For this, research thoroughly your audience about what word(s) they will use to search you on the search engine. Incorporate them into your content. However, do not use more than three or four keywords in one webpage. Exceed can be harmful, and even Google can penalize you for misusing keywords. So, be very careful.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Short and Long Tail Keywords</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This point is the extension of the second one, but I am writing this separately to emphasizing more. Keywords are king for any content, and the importance of them cannot be neglected. There are two types of keywords: Short-tail keywords and Long-tail Keywords. Short-tail keywords are search maxims with one word, whereas long-tail keywords are phrases with three-four words. Which type is more productive, is crucial to understand. According to SEO experts, the use of Long-tail keyword is more common, and so it should be incorporated into content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Social Media Network</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Having a social media presence helps you achieving more business recognition and customers</a>. In fact, social media is like a breeding ground which should be used wisely. Business owners, sometimes, lack users’ interests and find it difficult to get more conversion. Here in such situation, the platform helps you by providing you more recognition with the help of its 2.8 billion active users.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Email Marketing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With the technological advancement and social media presence, it seems like the use of email is decreasing. However, still, email marketing has its own importance when it comes to solving common problems your business face, such as sales funnel insufficiency and poor lead conversion. This type of marketing helps you a lot. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or ask sales or contributions, and is meant to build devotion, faith, or brand awareness. It is also crucial for building relationships with prospects, leads, and new customers as it gives you a chance to communicate directly to them and convince, in their inbox, at a time that is suitable for them.</p>
<p>Finally, I would say that one who knows even little about the marketing industry cannot refuse the significance of it. The industry is booming and getting more authority on each successive day. In fact, the future also seems more prosperous.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a single person living in this digital era can say ‘NO’ to the importance of Marketing. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">Marketing is compulsory for any business</a>. It is something through which you can make your product well-known in the eyes of the people. Not limited to this, the industry is developing on each successive day. Marketing can be referred as a breeding ground that has opened many doors of success not only for business but also for many folks. But, unfortunately, like many industries, this industry also become a prey of irrelevant myths. So, let’s check out some of the important myths of marketing:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/08/simple-introduction-custom-web-design/">A Simple Introduction To Custom Web Design</a></p>
<p>Myth #1: <strong>Customers Take Your Social Posts for granted</strong></p>
<p>It is not true. Customers read your social content and it also can convince and influence their purchasing decisions. The study reveals, “Nearly 70% of B2C companies and 40% of B2B companies have developed their customer base through social networking sites.” It doesn’t matter much what the social network is, any text, video, image, contest or coupon you publish will get countless eyeballs in this breeding ground with 2.2 billion users.</p>
<p>Myth #2: <strong>Marketing Should Define Future Products&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>It is believed that marketing group allegedly has a grip on what consumers want or prefer in a product or services, as characterized by a list of &#8220;market requirements.&#8221;  Though, in many cases, the marketing group doesn&#8217;t know much about customers’ requirements because of the communication gap. Most of the vendors only know about their current accounts think they want in the future.</p>
<p>Myth #3: <strong>Social media Heals Reputation Wounds</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/how-to-market-a-product">Marketing is all about promoting products to make sales</a>. Not taking care about website feedback is not helpful here. Receiving that outraged Rip-off Report is enough to put an end to your business reputation in search engine results. Each word you say matters a lot and cannot be taken back. In case of any problem, make sure that your social media pages possess active administrators authorized to alleviate any problem immediately, individually and systematically. Well, this myth is true at some extent.</p>
<p>Myth #4: <strong>No need to evaluate social success By Communal Interactions</strong></p>
<p>Sales opportunities or profits should measure the ultimate success you get through social interactions. Interactions may also help you with sales opportunities; but, if you don’t close any of those leads, the campaign will be nothing but a disappointment, regardless of how many interactions were bred. Marketing is about drive higher sales in which evaluation is essential to know which strategy is functional.</p>
<p>Myth #5: <strong>Marketing Costs Nothing</strong></p>
<p>The marketing industry is booming on each successive day. The scope and the benefits your business will get are countless. With such broader scope, the industry plays a vital role in creating employment and also fruitful socio-economic progress. Though the use of social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube are all free to use, hidden costs always exist when applying a social media marketing campaign for most customer boost.</p>
<p>For an active and fetching social media promotion, you need an expert who prioritizes and implements the plan, be able to message, and monitors the mediums for customer response. And it is apparent that he will charge heavy bucks for this job.</p>

<p><strong><em>So, here are some tips:</em></strong></p>
<p>Tip #1: Check out each channel, study them and find out the channel which will work more effectively for your business. Try to consider some of the factors with each channel: The product or service you are offering and the available resources at your disposal. Social media is free, but your time is precious enough to care.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Don’t use every channel or sign up on every platform for just because they’re new in the market or getting popular on the souk. Instead, find out the channel which is most relevant, effective to the business you’ve chosen to appeal your customers.</p>

<li>You will see more posts from the people you know, or you love. Especially from those friends and family who you talk to the most. This is a step back, though not a full redaction, of a previous update, which began limiting the number of friends’ posts you see on your news feed.</li>
<li>You will see fewer posts and videos about topics you are interested in and more posts from friends you are interested in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your Facebook Business Strategies Will Have To Change:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The persona of your business will be damage, and your business’ voice will lessen down unless you change your Facebook Business Strategies. Here are some of the reasons:</li>
<li>An organic post which is not paid from brand pages and businesses will be shown a smaller amount than they have been in the previous.</li>
<li>Even the bulk amount of Likes and shares will not help your posts as they used to.</li>
<li>The chances are you may have to buy ads to get the same result, but your ads are more likely to perform better than they used to be.</li>
<li>You need some comments on your Facebook posts to achieve the same amount of popularity once you have earlier. This may not be much of a problem for pages with a massive following, but it can hurt small business pages.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Some Important Strategies:</strong></h2>
<h2>Increase your Social Perspectives or Horizons</h2>
<p>You would not waste your precious time with people who don’t like or ignore you. You can find your new friends. No exceptions with social media. Use some of the time you devote to Facebook to explore other options such as Linkedin, Twitter and YouTube are some names.</p>
<h2>Use More Live Video</h2>
<p>In future, Facebook will be presenting not more video to users, but that doesn’t reckon for live video. Live videos are engaging and Facebook like that. It will rank a live video in your business supporters’ feeds.</p>
<h2>Create Engaging Content</h2>
<p>Always remember that Content is king. So, make sure you are <a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/26-ways-to-create-engaging-content/">making a content that is valuable and engaging</a>. In fact, Facebook favor posts that get more eyeballs. You have to write compelling content relevant to the niche. Likes and shares are essential but not the primary factor in post popularity once the change is carried out. You need content that stimulates the commenting type of engagement.</p>

<h1>Get More Out Of SMM with Facebook Photo Contest</h1>
<p>If you want to engage your users with your post and generate a lead, then run a photo contest on Facebook. It is a smart way to get more eyeballs. You have to use any reliable app to run a contest in a tab on your page, and prompt your followers to submit photos related to your brand. This practice helps you to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">increase engagement and spread awareness of your Facebook page.</a></p>
<p>Beware about the rules of the Facebook contest. These should not be acceptable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like a page to enter</li>
<li>Share a page to join</li>
<li>Share a page on a friends Timeline to enter</li>
<li>Tag yourself in a photo to enter</li>
<li>Like multiple pages to enter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Run a Facebook Live Campaign</h2>
<p>In the past few years, live streaming is becoming more common. In fact, interacting with the fans can multiply a level of trustworthiness and authenticity to your social media marketing. This could be a live interview to answer the queries of your customers related to your brand; taking live calls or messages; to promote your latest line of products. By doing so, you can drive your audience’s attention in your brand.</p>
<h2>Run a Twitter Poll</h2>
<p>Twitter Poll is one of the less-used features. Running a poll on twitter is an excellent way to get engagement from your customers. They are engaging and a smart way to start a discussion with your followers. The Twitter poll offers you with endless options. They allow followers make decisions for you. So, see how these Polls help your business&#8217;s personality shine.</p>
<h2>Host a Livestream on your Instagram Story</h2>
<p>Instagram is a great platform to capture and share the world&#8217;s moments, Follow other, and discover accounts from all around the globe. This community with over 500 million users has made their live video broadcasting feature available for people. Instagram Livestreaming seems quite similar to Facebook live stream, but there’s some difference– the primary difference is that Instagram videos cannot be stored anywhere, meaning your viewers can only watch when you’re genuinely live. Use Instagram’s live video broadcasting and get creative with it and see how your followers respond! Post consistently</p>
<h2>Post Consistently on YouTube</h2>
<p>Give your viewers an enticement to subscribe to your YouTube channel with the guarantee of a constant strain of high-value content. Frequent posting is essential on YouTube just like other platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Your users will not be as fascinated in your channel if they don’t see you posting not regularly. For driving more traffic to channel, the best trick is to influence the traffic you breed on other platforms. Just feature your new video on your homepage and create a new blog post for it.</p>
<h2>End of the Line</h2>
<p>There you go – five simple tips for your professional social media marketing. I sure hope these tips will help you with your social strategy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently, there are more than two billion users on Facebook. On the other hand, Instagram has around 800 million monthly users. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">With a ranking of such high-value social audiences on these two platforms</a>, you have better chance to find out your desired audience. In fact, today you can see many influencer marketing campaigns accomplished by multiple brands on these platforms &#8212; most of them are successful, fortunately.</p>
<p>Discovering the right influencers on social networks is a great start, but it isn’t the something that acts as a magical weapon. You have to build on or simplify your influencer interactions to guarantee that your campaigns drive brand awareness and ultimately improving your bottom line.</p>
<p>So, here are some indications that your social influencer campaign isn’t working as it ought to be:</p>

<h1>1.    Your Influencer Content Isn’t Reaching Their Viewers</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, Organic reach is falling. If we talk about Facebook, it dropped by 50% during the last year. It is alarming. By this means, your influencer’s content is not reaching to their viewers. In fact, the Instagram influencer’s post can only be view by around 20% of their spectators.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is not the fault of your influencers. They generate valuable content that resonates with the spectators. Our so-called Social media platform is not a “pay to play” thing. The good news is the pay element is a whole lot inexpensive than initiating more influencers.</p>
<p>Think or study how you’re giving support to your influencers. Are you just giving a note to your influencers with the message? Unfortunately, that isn’t enough to do. Instead, generate and share materials that’ll benefit your influencers get a better perceptive of your product. And go crazy with your creativeness.</p>
<h1>2.    Sales or Coupons Are the Only Motivation for Your Audience to Visit</h1>
<p>A long message, like one-time-use coupon or voucher, makes it stress-free for you to generate leads but this will stop coming in once the elevation finishes. Contrariwise, the magnificence of influencers is their ability to associate longstanding.  In fact, discount or a new coupon can weaken your trustworthiness, if they’re being offered every week. Instead, your primary goal should be getting a reliable engagement.</p>
<h1>3.    If Your Current Influencers Are Stopped Delivering</h1>
<p>Influencers, just like the brand or products, have a life cycle, too, it is a tough time for you &#8212; if your influencers aren’t generating the numbers which they used to breed. For such circumstances, pay consideration to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evolution of their niche</li>
<li>Variations in engagement trends</li>
<li>Saturation of their audience</li>
<li>More sponsorships</li>
</ul>
<h1>4.    Your Influencer’s Other Posts Aren’t Appropriate</h1>
<p>It is not something beneficial to think or expect relevancy from your influencers about your product. On the other hand, if your influencer posts about the products feel inappropriate compared to every other piece of their content, it indeed is.</p>
<p>To find the appropriate influencers fit your slot, keep an eye on the following tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out some great influencers who’re excellent at their work. <a href="http://thecoffeedate.com/blog/how-to-collab-on-instagram">Follow them and use Facebook or Instagram proposals to discover some more influencers.</a></li>
<li>Always good to study the competitors’ influencers. By studying them, you get many things more to know.</li>
<li>Be more particular and target the influencers who focus on a specific niche.</li>
<li>Make sure your message matches the influencers.</li>
<li>Get more details through Instagram user-endpoint API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, I would say, try something unique and don’t give up!</p>

<h1>HIGHLIGHT YOUR CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTONS ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h1>
<p>Placing a call to action on your website is not tough, but putting them in the right place is essential. Build your CTA wisely to get more eyeballs of visitors and induce them to click. Offer your visitors things that they can&#8217;t refuse.</p>
<p>The call to action, better known as the “CTA,” is an appeal to visitors, inviting their response on a webpage, acting as an indication that guides the user through the next steps. If your call to action is not clear enough then the user may not know the following steps to take to purchase a product or sign up for a newsletter. In many cases, visitors leave the website without completing their task.</p>
<h2>USE TWITTER FOR LEAD GENERATION ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE</h2>
<p>The platform works almost for every business. The task is just to discover the right people and engaging them, which can be as simple as following them or taking part in a conversation. For the respective purpose, you can find people using Twitter search with relevant hashtags or keywords, or use LinkedIn to find specialists. You can also take help with some tools like CrowdFire or Followerwonk. The entire process requires a significant amount of time, but if done wisely, can produce prominent consequences. Of course, you have to link your twitter account with your website.</p>
<h2>TEST, TEST, TEST</h2>
<p>One cannot overlook the importance of this process. Variety of testing options available, among them A/B testing can do wonders for knowing your click-through rates and so making them better.</p>
<h2>CREATE A MICRO LANDING PAGE</h2>
<p>You have not more than five seconds to convince people landing on your website to stick around and spend their valuable time on your site. For the respective purpose, the micro landing page is a full-page popup that comes in response to the user behavior. Creating a well-designed micro landing page and adding to the home page can increase conversion rates more than your thinking.</p>
<h2>USE EXPLAINER VIDEOS</h2>
<p>Explainer videos- <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/longer-is-better/">we all know are a perfect thing for attracting visitors to your site</a> and explaining them about the benefits and features of your product on the website. As the average user spends about 10-20 seconds on a website if there is no convincing reason to stay longer. But, adding things to their interests like explainer videos make them stay longer on your site. Moreover, it has emerged as one of the best tools for lead generation.</p>
<h2>END OF THE LINE</h2>
<p>Lastly, leads are imperative, not catching the lead means that website’s visitors are probably lost forever. In fact, lead generation site has noticeable differences compared to the rest.
