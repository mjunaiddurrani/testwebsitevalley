				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American billionaire businessman, Scott Cook says, “A brand is no longer what we tell the consumer it is – it is what consumers tell each other it is.” This valuable quote alone speaks so much about the significance of a brand and its effect beyond our thoughts. Branding depicts the entire personality, equity and image of the company. From logo design to campaign copy everything has a significant contribution in the company’s ideology, philosophy and core purpose of its message can be understood with the right kind of branding.</p>

<p>Branding is the most powerful aspect of your company therefore you should be very careful about what it looks like and what things it shall reflect to your target market. Sometimes there are minor loopholes in your branding strategy that fail the brand and ultimately cause you to revamp the entire image of your brand all over again. Rebranding your company is a tricky decision that may also be pretty costly and companies who consider about rebranding should keep certain things in mind.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips that will help your business with the decision of rebranding taken righteously!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong>Figure out the need</strong></h1>
<p>– Determining the reason for rebranding is very important. The reason could be just anything but defined. It can be anything that covers a negative reputation that your company might have underwent or your customers simply don’t respond you the way you wanted them to. As the reasons are explored, they help you with a proper plan of rebranding.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Create a Plan</strong></h2>
<p>– For all kinds of decisions in any business, a proper roadmap is highly necessary. Once you have noted down the core points that trigger your mind towards getting a revamp on your company’s brand, you must create a plan of how to start doing it. Rebranding can possibly be started as simply as just changing the color of your company’s logo or twisting its design a bit.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Revamp the Logo </strong></h2>
<p>– <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Redesigning the logo will be the most evident step while rebranding as the logo is the prime identity of any company</a>. It would be good to start with it!</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Modify Packaging</strong></h2>
<p>– If you are a company that sells certain kind of products then changing the package designs could also be an important tip. It is believed that the last and closest campaign that a company runs to reach out their customer is the product packaging so this can possibly be an important tool.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Twist your Ad Campaigns </strong></h2>
<p>– If your brand or company has been using a certain kind of content since forever, then maybe this is the right time to twist that a bit to give a revamped message to your audience.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Do some Customer Research</strong></h2>
<p>– Knowing your customers is good but learning what they need is very important. If you know what are the likes and dislikes of your customers, it becomes easier for you to recreate an image that matches well with their taste. Social Media is a helpful tool that can get you an appropriate response.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Change Brand Colors –</strong></h2>
<p>Playing around with your Brand’s color is a risky but effective approach of rebranding. Brand colors have a special kind of identity associated with your company.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Compare your Brand</strong></h2>
<p>– A sensible comparison between you and your competitors done beforehand can result in a proactive attempt for rebranding. You can learn from the achievements and mistakes made by them.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Think Ahead</strong></h2>
<p>– <a href="https://www.figmints.com/blog/5-companies-that-differentiated-in-crowded-markets-with-brand-strategy/">Your rebranding strategies shall be aligned with your future plans</a>. Thinking ahead vitally shall be a key that you keep in mind while changing the entire brand.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why wait any longer to create and deliver a strong persona of your brand to the customers. Just, work hard from the very beginning and get more eyeballs with your unique brand identity. And for the <a href="https://peartland.com.au/creating-a-unique-brand-identity/">unique brand identity you must have to do something unique</a>, but don’t worry you can take help with the ways I’ve mentioned below.</p>
<p>So, scroll through:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/01/4-symptoms-instagram-facebook-influencer-campaigns-arent-operating/">4 SYMPTOMS YOUR INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK INFLUENCER CAMPAIGNS AREN’T OPERATING</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Be very clear about the goals, ambitions, and capabilities</h1>
<p>It is very crucial to be clear about organization’s goals, ambitions and capabilities. The questions like, what do you want to be and are you really that now? If you are that, how do you deliver a message to your people? It is just important to grasp the business’ current situation, where it wants to be and what it can achieve in coming few years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Understand the customer, and what drives buying in your category and the segment you are pointing</h1>
<p>Another important thing which I think most important is to study your customers. In case if you have no time to take a time-consuming surveys of market and audience, simple hire sales director to ease your workflow. Another option is a proxy, in case if you can’t go to the customers then get a proxy. Just make sure your brand is customer-centric.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Tell an emotional story to your audience</h1>
<p>Emotional and sad stories are two entirely different genres. So, don’t confuse or mix one with other. Your goal is to develop an effective brand identity, and for this, your task should be around the emotions of your customers. Yes, you have to play with their emotions wisely and with love.</p>
<p>Emotional stories excite people more, make them laugh or make them feel inspective. So, you have to create your emotional story. Ask yourself what type of emotion does your brand typically produce from customers? If you are an e-commerce brand, you probably have to say something about the ease of online shopping. Tell stories through video, photo and written content, whatever you think work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>•    Analyze and Refine the Brand Identity</h1>
<p>We all know how tough it can be for a person to create a brand, he has to go through too many technical and daunting tasks. And, it would be so difficult to change it. Once you have established your brand, it is your duty to routinely examine and refine their brand to make sure it&#8217;s delivering on the promises of what the business stands for.</p>
<p>As Raquel Baldelomar said, “<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">One of the benefits of digital advertising is the ability to track, target, and test new strategies and tactics</a>. Your brand identity should not just be a mission statement on the wall and logo. Your brand is a reflection of your chracter, your thinking, and your values’.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s not that difficult to get busy in the day to day workings of your business. You may think that you have less or no time to make your online presence prominent. Many of us feel about content or products as the lifeblood of great brand experiences. But most of us take for granted the <a href="https://www.bluefrogdm.com/blog/brand-strategy-the-top-5-benefits-of-rebranding">importance of having a great design in rebranding.</a></p>
<p>But, why brands need to take a step of rebranding their existing brands?</p>
<p>Being a businessperson, you can have many reasons as to why you want to rebrand your existing business. It will benefit you to list down all your aims and objectives before starting anything or else the idea to rebrand will only run down your business’ image.</p>
<p>When you already know about your objectives you can prepare yourself better and make yourself more attentive towards the act. Some of the good reasons for rebranding could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the existing persona of your company</li>
<li><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Give importance to the new set of brand promotions</a></li>
<li>Deal or recover with the negative image of the business</li>
</ul>

<h1>Here’s why great design matters to your brand:</h1>
<p>No doubt people coming from different backgrounds love things that are well-structured or have an appealing design. Like, a trendy new restaurant will make more customers if it has an enthralling design compared to that one with unappealing designed. In fact, there are many studies which show that great brand design not only makes people cheerier, it also makes them pay more money for your brand.</p>
<p>Like, there are numerous local neighborhood restaurants which have been running successfully for decades and do the fine job without any flashy branding sparkles. They still perform their tasks what people need – offer delicious food and best services.</p>
<h2>Other Reasons: Why Great Design Matters For Rebrand your Brand?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Even dots and dashes matter in your design. If you give importance to details, then you will be perceived as a premium by your customers.</li>
<li>The first impression is the last impression. It is true, and you can create strong experiences. Especially, if you’re a new brand owner.</li>
<li>You can make your customers feel better and as I said above to make them spend more time on your product.</li>
<li>The excellent design ensures your content remains user-friendly and so search friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Lastly, I would say rebranding your existing brand can be equally difficult as branding the first time. Whether you are doing this for the first time or the third time you need to be very careful about every step.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The logo is a face of the brand that explains what your brand is. Designing a right logo can lead your business towards success. Logo designing is not an easy task; it requires strong research about the ongoing and even upcoming tends.</p>
<p>Following are the five essential tips to know for crafting a killer logo:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/02/27/8-effective-seo-tips-rank-beginner-website/">8 effective SEO tips to rank beginner website</a></p>
<h1>Identify your brand</h1>
<p>The logo is an explanation of your business that should be potent enough to communicate with the targeted audience. Therefore, it should possess all the elements of the business that are mandatory to be delivered to the audience. List the things about your brand and especially its ideology. Link your ideologies with symbols and elements that best convey your brand`s message and use these elements smartly to create a logo. Be precise, use hidden clues and follow ‘less is more strategy’.</p>
<h2>Color’s psyche</h2>
<p>Remember your brand’s logo is not just a small colorful image. In fact, it involves a whole psyche of colors behind each element. Color psyche is vital to know in <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">logo designing</a>.  Some shades of colors are considered as harsh while some are cool. According to the color theory, the red color is considered as energetic while the orange shade produces friendly or youthful vibes. Yellow is used for cheerfulness, and the green color is for instructional purposes. The blue tones are used in professional or medical product logo.  Purple is for spirituality, black demonstrates power, white reflects simplicity, whereas pink color is commonly used in toys or other babies’ stuff. So try to opt the most appropriate color as per your business nature and customers psyche.</p>
<h2>Timelessness</h2>
<p>Timelessness matters a lot. Because you’re crafting a logo that will stay for years. So, try to come up with a design that is productive enough to interact with the people of not only today but tomorrow. Study deeply about the social transformations; how choices are changing, what are the values of people and other social trends. While studying the present design trends, try to predict the upcoming trends and make your logo accordingly.</p>
<h2>Thorough Research</h2>
<p>Research is mandatory in every aspect of designing to get success, including <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/02/the-ultimate-guide-to-logo-design/">logo designing.</a> Even the brands with the big name have their separate research team that is responsible for brief market trends, social aspects, market drifts, risk factors, etc. They study audience, their preferences, brand’s competitors, company’s long-term goals and every single aspect of the business that helps logo to stand out from the others.</p>
<p>Most of the start-up companies do not possess separate research panels for designing a logo.Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn`t. But it would be nearly impossible for the logo to fail to grab attention if all the aspects were thoroughly-researched.</p>
<h2>Simplicity and minimalism</h2>
<p>Try to keep logo as simple as possible because your logo will be used everywhere – from site to pamphlets or even from shoes to clothes. The heavy ornamentations, large fonts, clashing colors schemes can ruin your logo.</p>
<p>Consider popular logo designs too, and see how the simplicity works. One of the best examples of simplicity is NIKE, we all know how famous the logo is and how simple it is. It is a perfect example of minimalism approach while creating a logo. On the other hand, complicated logo designs are less likely preferable because complex logos are tough to identify. They are less memorable and less appealing.</p>
<p>Lastly, remember your logo is your brand’s identification. Follow mentioned tips to make a killer logo.</p>

SWOT analysis of your idea can help you understand the strength and weaknesses. You can calculate the risk of failure and can redesign your strategy for better results.</p>

Then market your brand in a way that your message and best features of your product reach the maximum number of relevant audience. Prepare a  probability graph to calculate ROI of your plan and act accordingly.</p>
<h2>Minimalism</h2>
<p>Extra is not the trend of the market now. <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/minimalism-growth/">Minimalism is the phenomenon</a> of pitching and presenting what is required only. Rather than wasting your time, money and energy on extra ornamentations its good to organize and manage what is important. From the name of your brand till the <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">website design</a> try to hold the approach of minimalism. Simple brand name, logo, packaging, website design, and advertisements are more impactful because they are easy to understand.</p>
<h2>Utilize Maximum Resources</h2>
<p>To market your brand and to add value to it, you can use several platforms at a time to hit the most number of targeted audience. It is not necessary to always focus on paid marketing and advertisements, your marketing plan must include free and easy assessable options as well. For example, social media account management, promotions, and sales for regular followers of the page, V-log, product tutorials etc. Try to utilize most of the available sources so that you can spread your brand more and more within less time.</p>
<h2>Show Your Presence</h2>
<p>Active participation to show your existence helps customers to trust your brand. You can set high positions in the market by grabbing people`s attention at events and celebrations. Your active presence on your social media pages, quick responses for queries of people and visibility in special events will make people think about your brand every time they will be buying certain products or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, you will follow the mentioned techniques to build your brand more effectively and to expand your sales graph.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>User Interface and User Experience are the two terminologies that hold the criteria of good or bad designing in the world of websites. The more user-friendly design is, the more benefits it caters. The major reasons for making design simple and easy to make it understandable. Also, people want a website that guides them with necessary points in an easy yet convincing way.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/01/12/3-reasons-2018-year-video-content-engagement/" rel="bookmark">3 Reasons Why 2018 Is the Year for Video Content Engagement</a></p>
<h1>More Views More Sales</h1>
<p>The minimal term refers to simplicity in design. The phenomena of removing all unnecessary and decorative elements to make the website design sophisticated and user-friendly is being the current trend. The reason designers are incorporating it into their work is that consumers are found to view such websites more. More views and more exploration on the website directly lead to more sales.</p>
<p>We can say that<a href="https://usabilitygeek.com/less-is-more-importance-minimalist-web-design/"> minimalism approach in designing</a> can make the process of sales easier and faster and this is all that a company wants.</p>
<h2>Time-Saving for Designers and Developers</h2>
<p>Another benefit of minimalism in web designing is the time-saving factor. The whole process of <a href="https://superdevresources.com/web-design-development-blogs/">designing and development</a> is much easier when with minimalism approach in designing is adopted. Today the ongoing trend is of customized website designing so design houses or individual designers cannot pay hours and hours to one project hence they minimalism provides them ease. The design is functional and easily operated that it is proficient for customers.</p>
<h2>Quick look, Quick Decision</h2>
<p>Previously people use to spend hours on the decorative and extra elements, at that time this approach was fascinating because there were limited websites active for any specific service or product but now the competition is tough and people have a lot of options when they search for anything. In such circumstances people open a website, give it a quick look, if they find it easy going or understandable they pay some time to it otherwise they quickly shift to other websites.</p>
<p>For such quick look, quick decision nature of consumers, it is ideal to present things in a way that they get the brand`s message at first glimpse.</p>
<h2>Highlight what is Important</h2>
<p>As the website has selective things it is easy for designers to bring out important things to the front. The simple tactics like changing the size of the font or adding bright colors to key points grab the attention of viewers quickly. Also, consumers find the specific website, easy to explore because they don’t have to dig out required information from a junk of content. Because it highlights what is most important it actually helps users to operate the website easily and somehow convince them to buy mentioned products or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those were some the reason why we think the minimal <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">design is the future of web UI/UX.</a> The most important point is that audience is loving such designs. For a brand as well as for a designer this is the most considerable point of adopting minimalism design approach in future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most demanded projects are to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Motion-Graphics">design explainer videos for clients</a>. These videos are a great way to brief and promote about your brand in just few seconds. Crafting explainer video seems like a piece of cake but if you look deep into the minor details of the production; there are a lot of departments involved in it. From the big idea to writing script, designing character, syncing voiceover and creating a surrounding according to the need of client.</p>

It includes all the elements of the entire marketing campaign. Your design should explain the nature of your product or service without any verbal explanation.</p>
<h1>Create an engaging content with a strong brand story</h1>
<p>Your content is one of the most essential tool in the production of explainer videos. You should highlight all the features in the form of benefits for your consumers. Ask questions that bother people and tell them how your product or service can solve it.<br />

<h2>Use Typography as an essential tool</h2>
<p>In typography, you have a vast area to show your creativity. Your font should define the nature of your product or service, whether it’s formal, casual or funky. Do not use more than three typefaces in your entire campaign. Pick a font for your heading, body copy and sub headlines and follow it accordingly.<br />
Use purposeful negative spaces between your texts. Make your font and typographic images readable. Your text should define the mood of your message.<br />
<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">A professional designer</a> can create objects out of fonts using their typographic art language. Do not write text on texture as it distracts the reader and make it difficult for them to grab the message.</p>
<h2>Introduce Brand Character</h2>
<p><a href="https://creativemarket.com/blog/designing-a-brand-identity">Design your brand character</a> that narrate your brand story and define your product in an innovative way. The colors, accent and body language should interpret the brand’s persona. Brand characters in animated explainer videos create a human approach towards the viewers as they can relate their lives to the character and your video’s surrounding easily.</p>
<p>Start your content with a key phrase or a question to grab your viewers’ attention.<br />
Take inspirations from well-known artists. Before crafting any design for your explainer video, schedule pre-production meetings with your explainer video agency. Keep an eye on whatever your competitors are doing, it helps you in moving one step forward from them in the market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever laid your eyes on a logo that’s just plain bad? I bet you have. It seems like a terrible thing to say, but it’s a fact that the increase in bad logo designs are increasing. Laymen or design professionals, no matter who you are, some logos are just too hard to like. Some people actually consider a bad logo to be a reflection of ‘brand weakness’. Believe it or not, these ‘people’ happen to be some of the best design professionals in the world.</p>
<p>So, if you’re a logo designer or maybe a logo design company that designed a bad logo, does that make you a bad design professional/agency? The answer is no. Even the best of us make mistakes. However, these mistakes come back to haunt you heavily when the time comes. Why wait for a career suicide when you can work on the red flags and turn them green?</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’ll be discussing some of the most prominent mistakes that logo designers make frequently. So without running around in circles, let’s jump right into it.</p>
<h2><strong>A Very Busy Logo Design</strong></h2>
<p>This is perhaps one of the biggest mistakes that I’ve seen over the years. In fact, I’ve seen esteemed experts in the design industry such as Jason Li, Co-Founder of Tum Yum DeSignagency discuss this problem in the past as well. You can have a look at his blog <a href="https://medium.com/tomyum/logo-design-af5080273895">here</a>.</p>

<p>A busy logo is always going to get a bad impression from the targeted audience. If there’s too much going on in the logo design, your potential custom won’t know where to pay attention. One of the many reasons why minimal design is progressing in general. There’s always one ‘sweet spot’ in your logo that really is key in creating results. When there’s too much happening in the logo, you won’t really get the chance to impress your customer. Of course, elements are important to your logo, but make sure the design in the perfect flow. Focus on not overcrowding the logo with unnecessary elements. In most cases, one single element is enough to do the trick.</p>
<p><strong>Also </strong>Read: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/07/21/design-brief-things-you-need-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Design Brief – Things You Need To Focus On</strong></a></p>
<h2><strong>Poor Focus on Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>This mistake is one of the most repetitive mistakes that I’ve seen happen. This even happens to the biggest of brands. As a logo designer and/or as a logo deSignagency, you need to realize that the logo isn’t solely visible on one placement. From social media display pictures to business cards, the brand identity needs to customize itself. A huge part of the brand identity is the logo design itself and that’s where things get rough.</p>

<p>Thorough research on the logo design placements is very important. As a design professional, you need to have a list of placements lined up to offer the client. You can also include this as a question in your design brief. Most of the times, clients aren’t well aware of brand identity. As a logo design professional, it is your duty to not only educate the client but assist them as well.</p>
<h2><strong>A Victim to Cliché </strong></h2>
<p>Now, this is one mistake that sometimes rattles up a lot of logo designers and even logo design companies. From the sparks, to the bevels and even the swooshes, there are several cliché design trends that are overused in the industry.</p>

<p>What confuses graphic designers around the world is that at one hand people endorse design trends and at the other, hate them in general. Well, it’s simple. There are several areas where design trends actually work. Logo Design isn’t one of them. A notable example is Material Design that is being followed by designers worldwide for app and web design. On the contrary, it can’t be used in the field of logo design. Logos define individuality and if there’s even a small similarity between two logos, the logo isn’t worth it. To avoid this mistake, research is key. Make the most out of your research and your logo design will almost always be a masterpiece with its standalone brilliance.</p>
<p>All in all, these are three of the biggest mistakes that are consistently invading the logo design industry. Your logo is vital for your business, regardless of your industry. Focus on your brand’s identity and it will change the way your customers react to your business in general.

<h2><strong>Study the industry</strong></h2>
<p>The first thing that you need to keep in mind is that ‘Less is more’. What do you mean by that? We’ll tell you right away. Let’s say you work at a shoe company with business cards that are minimal and sleek. You on the other hand want to do something fancy. That’s great, but will your audience be able to absorb that impact? Well, that really is the question. Usually stationery of the same industry work around the same by lines. It’s good to work with something unique but if it doesn’t woo your audience, it isn’t worth it.</p>
<h2><strong>Follow your design guideline</strong></h2>

What you need to realize is that if you deviate from your base design at this point, it will leave you in a brand damaging problem. Always create a stationery design that sticks with your brand’s base design.</p>
