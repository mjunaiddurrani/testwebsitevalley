				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The history of animation is linked to ancient Egyptian era, people of that times used to carve sculptures that repeat their motions in a specific pattern. The technique at that time used to be considered as some spiritual power is making the idol to move. Spinning wheels were also used to create the ambiance of motion of objects creating some certain moves.</p>
<p>The idea, later on, was adopted by illustrator and sketchers to create a series of pictures. These pictures were created and places in a way that when compiled and played speedily, they seem to create an animation.</p>

<h1>2D Animation</h1>
<p>Though technology is spreading its wings day by day and in the market even 6D animation videos are being created by several companies still the demand for 2D animation is high. Many companies prefer to place a<a href="https://marionettestudio.com/how-animation-and-graphics-are-changing-the-entire-marketing-world-2/"> 2D animation video</a> on landing pages of their website along with social media pages to provide an explanation about the features, uses and working of their products. The reason is that 2D animation production consumes less time and is cost-effective.</p>
<p>Another reason to prefer 2D animation video is that their production doesn`t require exceptional or very advanced technology. The software’s of 2D animation can efficiently function on even windows 7. So it`s quite simple to produce 2D animation, and yet it benefits marketing brand a lot. For products and services that are common, simple and a necessity, 2D animation videos are ideal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3D Animation</h2>
<p>For luxury products, fashion or design related products and services and <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">digital marketing</a> firms’ 3D animation videos are a potent tool to generate a brand`s impact on the customers. It helps to convert potential clients into regular buyers. 3D animation videos are more realistic than 2D animation videos, and their influence is thrice attractive as well. Apparently, to generate a 3D animation video, you need a reasonable budget. The production of 3D animation is expensive and consumes more time.</p>
<p>The complex and multi-functional products are best explained through 3D animation because all the sides and aspects of products are defined well, and viewers can experience a more realistic perspective of the products. To stylize the image of any product or service and present your brand in a competitive way 3D animation video is the best idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><u>Scripting</u></h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To become a better web designer is a never-ending struggle as there is no limit to the creative ways through which you can enhance the layout of the website. To create an online masterpiece, a designer has to explore the depth of technical possibilities, experiment unique ideas and take sheer risks.</p>
<p>The layout of the <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/graphic-designer-secrets/">website reflects the designer’s talen</a>t and efforts but hard work is not all you need to bring out the best results. For designing an attractive website, the designers should take notice of some tips and tricks through which they can amplify their efficiency. You need to go through these ingenious ideas to hone your web designing skills.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1>Pay Attention to Latest Techniques</h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Web designing industry is heavily driven by trends. You do not necessarily need to follow trends but to get to the top of all you need to at least pay attention to the latest designing techniques being used commercially. Be a competent critique, develop an eye for holding the best ideas and master the skills of executing them in the most unique and inspiring ways.</p>
<p>ALSO READ:<a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/01/09/video-marketing-future-heres-3-reasons/"> Is video marketing the future? Here‘s 3 reasons why!</a></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Avoid Thinking of Coding While Layout Designing</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our will to experiment unique techniques often wavers when we start thinking about coding even before planning the layout. Your first draft of design should be relentlessly creative and based entirely on imagination without technical concerns. Develop the mock-up in Photoshop first and then dig into coding it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2>Banner Slideshow Won’t Work</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The trend of slideshow/image carousel previously became very popular but it doesn’t seem to outshine anymore. This layout is although inclusive in terms of information but with escalating competition in the web market, the user hardly stays that long to go through all banners. Be more particular and well-defined. Decide one prominent feature of your product and present it in the most appealing style.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2>Use Simpler Navigation</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We have come a long way beyond all those traditional headers or sidebars flooded with links and tabs.<a href="http://brolik.com/blog/simplify-navigation-better-usability-2/"> Simplify the navigation</a> by reducing the links. Avoid using dropdown and multi-tier menus as they often overwhelm the users.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2>Slide Away Social Media Icons</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The important information about your product should take the most prominent place on your webpage, not the social media icons. Placing these icons on header would be an unwise thing to do as you will invite users to leave just before they fully arrive. Place the icons in the footer and let users connect with your product first and then move further to find out more.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2>The Lesser the Better</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Motion-Graphics">If you want to design elegant</a> and sophisticated website, master the skill of using the white-space efficiently. Just hone this one hack and you can do wonders with your website designs. Observe and pay attention to minimal websites and learn to give your website enough room to breathe.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h2>Make Font Size Bigger and Colors Bolder</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In web design, typography and colors are incredibly important as they draw most of the attention of the user. Make your font stand out and clearly visible by increasing its size. Take inspiration from the beauty of nature and extract vibrant and contrasting palette of colors for your web landscape.</p>
<p>Now you know the drill and technique to play with your creativity. Just go ahead and create wonders.</p>

<p>Videos over landing pages can actually help increase conversion rate by 80% and also an addition of a video to marketing emails boost up click-through rates by 200 to 300%. That is why marketers are already using video content to promoter brands and products. They also consider it as the power tool for future marketing plans. Here is three major reason.</p>
<h1><u>Video Marketing Delivers Clear Brand Message to the Audience</u></h1>
<p>Online videos are considered as a good way to create an image of any specific brand. Video delivers the brand message better than blogs. Another major benefit of video is that they explain functionality and usage of any product. A clear explanation of product actually helps users to evaluate whether they need that product or not.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/3-creative-ways-to-use-live-video-for-business/">video is a creative way</a> to deliver information even about the most boring thing. In minimum time a great count of information can be delivered without making viewers bore or fed up.

<h2><u>Video Marketing Adds Value </u></h2>
<p>90% of customers consider that videos assist them to make purchasing decisions. Product videos provoke human mind to generate an ease of life by using the specified product. It can be said that videos sometimes generate a need for the product and help brand owners to sell their products to the people who had never tried or think of their product.</p>
<p>Videos cover a wide number of the audience so the probability is high that a video will hit the targeted audience. That`s why marketers consider videos as a major tool to beat competitors and invest good budget in producing brand videos. Video marketing adds value to the brand and also make customers to understand the place of brand or product in their life.</p>
<h2><u>Video Marketing Encourages Social Shares</u></h2>
<p>The trend of video sharing sometimes makes videos viral. Any viral product video is actually a hit set for the brand owners and a source to increase sells up to 80%. Online videos are a great way to have organic traffic over the social media page and eventually over the website. 90% people share videos on social media platforms or send videos through messengers without the intention of promoting any brand or product but the brand owners get the full benefit. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Motion-Graphics">That`s why it is suggested to create a creative video</a> and of a level that it can get viral or at least video have something for viewers for which they will share and spread the video.</p>
<p>Above mention, three reasons are genuine reasons that marketers present to the people to add video content to the marketing plan.</p>
