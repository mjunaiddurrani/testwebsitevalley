				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to increasingly fierce competition on search engines like Google and Bing, you need to work together to achieve a higher ranking on the search engine results page (SERP). For a law firm’s website to appear organically on the first page of the search engine, the site’s search engine optimization (SEO) must be optimized continuously. SEO techniques often include creating authoritative and keyword-rich content, creating an appropriate website structure, creating backlinks, and preventing the use of black hat techniques.</p>
<p>As a lawyer, you may find that Lawyer SEO is challenging. The competition is fierce, and there is a lot of spam. Advocacy marketing is a highly competitive industry, and each client is vital to the success of your business. Marketing for law firms is very tough, while online marketing is even more difficult and time-consuming. Eliminate digital marketing assumptions from law firms and hire SEO experts.</p>
<p>Today, in almost every industry, as long as you use SEO techniques in an industry-specific way, you can increase your company’s visibility on Google. If you are attracting more clients from a law firm and looking for more traffic to your website, consider improving your SEO resources. In this article, we will give a brief introduction to search engine optimization. This allows you to view the growth of online traffic and customers.</p>
<h2>What Is SEO?</h2>
<p>First, in order to improve your law firm’s search engine optimization, you need to know what it is. SEO stands for search engine optimization. It is a digital marketing technique that can increase website traffic, improving your ranking on search engines like Google and others. By optimizing your site, you can provide search engines and potential customers with clear information about who you are and what you do. This clarity leads to higher search engine rankings, which leads to more web traffic, more potential customers, and more customers.</p>
<h2>Tips To Optimize Your Law Firm Website With SEO</h2>
<h3>Always Use Relevant Keywords</h3>
<p>In order for your keywords to come to work, you need to make sure they are placed appropriately on the entire home page. Add keywords to titles, headings, and home page content. It is best to include the keywords with which you want to get the highest ranking in the title—for example, the central business area. Therefore, you need to use a “Phoenix DUI Lawyer” instead of an “Arizona Lawyer.”</p>
<h3>Content Creation</h3>
<p>You should regularly create new and relevant content that supports your keyword strategies. Optimize the content of web pages and blog posts and the corresponding background tags. A web page includes a home page, but it does not end there. For each service, you offer, create high quality, optimized service page, and a general service login page with links to each more specific service page.</p>
<p>You also must create an “About Us” page to attract the attention of site visitors. The contact information on each page facilitates contact. Google has a “freshness” rating mark so that it can reward sites with frequently updated content, and blogs are the ideal way to do this. In addition, blog posts can be used to target more search-based keywords.</p>
<h3>Make Sure Your Site Is Responsive &amp; Mobile-friendly</h3>
<p>Everyone uses smartphones today, and some people use smartphones instead of PCs to surf the internet. You want your site to be mobile-friendly so people can use it anytime, anywhere. When someone is seeking a lawyer, they wait patiently until the site loads on the phone or does not respond. This is a surefire way to lose potential customers. In addition, mobile-friendly sites are also an aspect of search engine optimization. Search engines like Google use responsive web design as a critical factor in ranking sites.</p>
<h3>Improve Website Speed &amp; Keep It Up To Date</h3>
<p>We are less patient than ever, and there is more information on the internet than ever. This means that when we have an unpleasant experience on any website, we are there! Having a fast-loading website is important for potential customers to stay and return to your website, as well as ranking your website on the search engine.</p>
<p>Make sure that all extensions are up to date. Reduce the size of images on a website. Minimize the number of HTTP requests needed to upload images, graphics, etc. to a page. Save and send the image in JPEGS format, it loads much faster than PNGS.</p>
<p>You don’t want to waste time researching keywords, developing a blog, and checking the speed of sites, so you spend months or even years. You need to make sure that your site is full of new content, links are not broken, and extensions are up to date. To continue to rank in SEO and attract new visitors, you must regularly review the content and performance of your website.</p>
<h3>Online Presence On Other Law Firm Platforms</h3>
<p>Yes, you also need to take care of your online status, not only your website but on other sites too. But this can bring optimized search engine optimization to your<strong><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/law-firm-web-design-development"> law firm’s website</a></strong>. If you have personal information on a website like NEXL, make sure that your personal information is displayed correctly, updated, and optimized. They can be updated according to discipline or location, and the content of these types of sites matches the content of your site, which can help to rank your site.</p>
<h3>One Of The Most Important Parts Of SEO “Link Building”</h3>
<p>Based on your SEO campaign, you need more high-quality inbound links, that is, links to your website that point to your website. If your link profile is healthy, Google will trust your site and reward you as a result. These links must come from related sites across different sets of domains. One way to expand links is to share content. You can share your content through social media, email marketing, and more. The proportion of persons who read your content will link to you.</p>
<p>Another option is to publish your website on a free or paid quality list and create a specific website for your law firm. If it is listed in the directory, check that the NAP is correct. Also, consider the member organization to which you belong (regardless of region, state, or country). These organizations publish and link law firms on your websites.</p>
<h3>Make Sure Your Pages Are Indexed</h3>
<p>If the page is not indexed, it means that the page will not appear in the expected search. This is bad for most pages, particularly the home page, the about us and the service pages. To find out the number of pages indexed, you can use a tool called “Website Auditor.” You can grasp the number of pages indexed using various online tools. You need a number close to the actual number of pages on your site. If there are any deficiencies, you can also hire SEO Experts to manage your website pages.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The lawyer’s website needs to be loaded as quickly as possible to maintain rankings and get more visitors and new prospects. If you are familiar with developing websites from the back-end, you are already one step ahead. In many cases, lawyers found that they didn’t have time to focus on customizing the site during the day of the trial. In that case, consider hiring experienced professionals to perform these tasks.</p>

<h1>Robots.txt and XML sitemap</h1>

XML sitemap provides the fast crawling and indexing of your website pages to let know Google about them. These files do not affect your ranking of the website but are essential factors for SEO.</p>
<h1>Meta keywords</h1>
<p>Meta keywords are the generic list of HTML keywords which help to show up ranking for your website.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All businesses today strive to increase the profit margin in order to smoothly manage and run their operations, expand services and offer a comparative advantage to the customers. However, this is easier said than done, especially in today’s modern and fast paced world where competition is tough.</p>
<p>Successfully aligning both the sales and marketing teams within a company is a practice which is as old as the entire corporate structure itself. For numerous companies, the marketing department’s job is to generate successful leads and the sale’s team’s job to turn them into loyal customers.</p>
<p>According to theory, it is important that both the marketing alongside the sales teams, work in tandem, to align shared goals as well as roles to ensure ROI becomes the responsibility or the organization, rather than that of individual teams.</p>
<p>Unluckily, building a solid team around marketing and sales alignment is usually easier said than done. Nevertheless, here are 5 brilliant ideas using which you can effectively implement an amazing strategy and make sure everyone keeps and works towards common goals and targets.</p>

<h1>Determine the Company’s Marketing Goals</h1>
<p>Even though this might sound a little cliché, but it is advised that you “Plan your work, and work your plan.” Developing a strategic plan is going to help your organization go a long way towards getting off to a very good start. When you are determining the marketing goals, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What new products and/or services will I be launching this year?</li>
<li>What is the overall revenue goal for this year?</li>
<li>What key metrics are extremely important when it comes to measuring my sales and marketing success?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Reduce Your Expenses</h1>
<p>One of the tried and tested ways using which you can bring up your sales is by reducing your expenses. For examples, you may want to consider having shared offices instead of having your own expansive and expensive space. Keep a track of your account books and identify where your money is going. After analyzing this, look for various different ways to reduce all the expenses incurred without actually compromising the business.</p>
<h1>Improve Your Customer Relationship</h1>
<p>You should also be active when it comes to improving your relationship with your clients. Focus on initiating loyalty. When consumers are loyal, you can trust that they will support your products, even when you increase prices, given that the quality remains top-notch. Research about your clients, think about customer segmentation, learn about what they need, and design approaches that will allow you to deliver a high level of consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is very easy to be overwhelmed when it comes to considering all the various different marketing choices and paths accessible to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">grow your business</a>. Nonetheless, with all signs pointing towards constant economic growth worldwide in the year 2018, there is still time to create a plan to increase revenue this year.</p>

<p>Let us discuss a few below!</p>
<p><strong>Keep your page load low</strong> – According to famous digital marketer and SEO expert, Neil Patel says that 40% of the people withdraw themselves from surfing on a page that takes more than 3 seconds to load. Make sure you craft the pages keeping these stats in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Make powerful and meaningful headlines</strong> – Headlines play an important role for SEO content. First of all your content must include headlines and these headlines should be in correct length and include relevant keywords in them.</p>
<p><strong>Make use of correct CTAs (Call to action)</strong> – <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/scannable-content/">SEO content must have a few lines that can drive the reader for an action</a>. You can do this by using words like “click, share or comment” at the end of your SEO blog or article.</p>
<p><strong>Address the reader</strong> – The sign of a good content is where the addressee is defined. The reader should be addressed directly throughout the content. This makes your content more engaging and optimizes its readability.</p>
<p><strong>Use of keywords</strong> – A well written content is the one which is backed by intelligent keyword research. A writer should know how to incorporate the picked keywords in their articles and follow the ratio in the content accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid using jargons</strong> – Jargons should not be used in great volume in a content. Try to go easy with words that can conveniently be understood by the readers.</p>

<h1>1st tip# Create great content</h1>
<p>If you want to rank high in the search engine, then a high content can help you the most. Websites with a fresh, genuine and relevant content are more likely to get a chance to rank. Avoid grammatical mistakes and spelling lower. The question, how long the content should be? must be popping in your mind. Well, there’s no exact answer to it, but it should be at least not smaller than 500 words. In fact, for many, it is good minimum length for a typical blog post.</p>
<p>If we go with research, then it has shown that posts longer than 1000 words tend to rank better. Search engine likes authoritative posts with more than 2000 words. It means, if you want to improve your ranking chances in the future with in-depth articles or blogs, you have to focus on both quality and quantity. The content must be excellent in quality, should be more than 2000 words. So, try to make your writings fun to read, avoid being too much promotional, don’t be boring and assure your content should not look like a legal document. As an alternative, opt for friendly, amusing content.</p>
<h2>2nd tip# Build backlinks to your website</h2>

This would be beneficial to your audience, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">will help improve your website’s SEO</a>, make it comfortable for readers to find something useful from your site.</p>
<h2>3rd tip# Optimized URLs</h2>

<h2>4th tip# Page titles</h2>
<p>Your website’s page must possess compelling and relevant title with some keywords. The title should be descriptive enough to grasp by the readers about the content. For instance, if your blog is about “Effective Logo Designing,” then a great title should be “Effective Logo Designing in ten easy tips” or “<a href="https://www.designhill.com/design-blog/simple-logo-design-recognition/">How to create an effective logo for your business</a>.” However, make sure that your page title should not longer than 70 characters. Although Google will index lengthier page titles, they will be shortened in the search results.</p>
<h2>5th tip# Header tags</h2>
<p>It would be perfect to incorporate the keyword phrase in a header tag, but make sure you’re not spoiling it. The ideal way to include a keyword phrase in a header tag is to use the first heading on the web page as the search engine will pay more attention to H1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6th tip# Make your Professional Web page load faster</h2>
<p>For search engine how much time your website takes in load matters a lot. In fact, it is ranking factor for Google.

If yes, then you’re at the top of the ladder. Transform your website’s conversion rate with these six actions to escalate website sales and turn site visitors into permanent followers:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/11/5-best-social-media-marketing-services-instantly-impact-sales/">5 Best Social Media Marketing Services That Instantly Impact Sales</a></p>
<h1>1.    One Brand, One Product, One Target Market</h1>
<p>If your website is selling a wide range of products and services, then must test whether this strategy is effective for making more sales or not. It has been found that proposing not more than two products in one place always translates into higher sales. Offering one product is ideal for one target market. And It is better to focus on one product and answers all the queries of your customers related to that product. Instead of trying to gratify your site visitors by giving them a large variety of products with less information about each service or product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>2.    Keep Up your website with Customers</h1>
<p>Do you know what’s more to focus on your website? It is your customers. <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/successful-sales-pages/">The most effective sales copy emphases on its customers or reader</a>. Unfortunately, many businesspersons do not give importance to this simple golden rule. Be very careful about your sales copy. See if it is filled with references to &#8220;I,&#8221; &#8220;me&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221;? It is always better to use “you” and “your” in content.  By so doing, you are assuring customer’s importance and making content customer-centric and increase sales on site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>3.    Search engines love Fresh web-content</h1>
<p>Fresh, good web content helps to gain trustworthiness, reliance and ultimately sales from the people who visit your website. Start with brainstorming, see how you can make your web content more useful. Make sure your site looks professional, fresh and genuine. It must include your mission statement and possess relevant information about you and your services. The best web content should be user-centric. It should offer the information your visitors pursue and to present it in engaging and organized manner.</p>
<p>Here are some effective tips to help make your web content fresh and good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use conversational Language.</li>
<li>Use acquainted terminologies.</li>
<li>Offer all the relevant information.</li>
<li>Prefer real photos for your site. They work best.</li>
<li>Explain why your business is uniquely equipped to offer its products or services.</li>
<li>Keep your web content always up-to-date</li>
<li>Mention your contact information in multiple places</li>
<li>Clearly explain to your site visitors what you would like them to do next</li>
<li>Proofread your content. See, if it’s free from grammatical mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>4.    Get More Sales with Social Networking</h1>
<p>Having great content on website is good. But, it is not enough to produce high content and make the expectation that visitors find it – you have to control a whole situation rather than just responding to it after any mishap has happened. You have to get social to boost website traffic. Use different social media channels to promote your content. With 1.4 billion users, Facebook is ideal for interacting with customers. Twitter has more than 300 million, is renowned as a momentous brand awareness driving force. Pinterest is a giant in attracting predominantly female audiences. Instagram is popular among the young audience.</p>
<p>No matter what social media channel you’re opting for, your web content must always be geared toward reaching those visitors who can become potential customers or true fan.</p>
<h1>5.    SEO can never get old.</h1>
<p>The practice is valuable and worth more than before. There are two types of SEO: on-page and off-page. The techniques like creating internal links to your content, making the most of image alt text, giving importance to Meta descriptions are still considered as the backbone of On-page SEO. They help boost your organic traffic. On the other hand, off page SEO techniques can be used to improve the position of a website in the SERPs. The techniques include: Contribute as Guest Author, Forum submissions, Blog Directory Submission, Article Submission, Influencer Outreach and the list is endless.</p>
<h1>6.    Keywords still matter</h1>
<p>If you want more traffic, more leads, and better sales, then you’ll have to learn the proper use of keyword optimization to get more business. In keywords, you have two choices: Short-tail keywords and long-tail keywords. Short tail keywords are search watchwords with only one or two words. Long-tail keywords are broader, have three or more words.  Long tail keywords are more targeted and have significant search volume. Before going to actual keyword research, take some quality time to ask a few questions to yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is my audience?</li>
<li>Type of content my readers want to read</li>
<li>What should I offer as a solution for my customers?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also take help with keyword tools and get hundreds of keyword suggestions for your site, personalized to your industry and place.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike paid traffic, <a href="https://www.smartbugmedia.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-direct-and-organic-search-traffic-sources">organic traffic refers to non-paid traffic</a>. It includes traffic from search engines, social media sites, referral traffic, and direct traffic. These are the traffic achieved organically, rather than any source of paid promotion or advertising.</p>
<p>Publishing the relevant and high-quality content on blog and website is one way to boost the organic traffic of your site. This is, in fact, most comfortable and functional technique used for obtaining new visitors on the website. SEO &#8211; search engine optimization is the outlet of online marketing that emphases directly on cultivating and boosting organic traffic.</p>
<p>Now, let’s suppose that Google is starting to choke organic traffic and limiting the visitors that can get to a site after searching. What would happen, then?</p>
<p>It’s not daydreaming. It&#8217;s happening now. Doubting how? Here’s how.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/08/brand-something-logo/">Why Your Brand Is Something Other Than Your Logo</a></p>
<h1>The Knowledge Graph</h1>
<p>Since the establishment, The Knowledge Graph has been getting more popularity. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">Google is using the Knowledge Graph to enhance its search engine’s services</a> with information collected from a variety of sources. Moreover, this refers to Google’s central database of information on movies, historical events, locations, and other topics; when a user searches any topic, a box on the right-side of the search engine results page will display relevant information to that topic along with links to Google pages for other related topics.</p>
<p>Now, it can be a long debate with a lot of confusions about whether The Knowledge Graph really steals organic traffic or not. No matter what, it is clear that anyone looking for his needed information in these boxes doesn’t require to click a link for any more information.</p>
<h1>Carousels</h1>
<p>What is Carousel? How it links with Google? To make sure a perfect web experience delivers to all its users. Google offers Carousel, the most valuable improvement which takes local search to the next level. Google carousels help people with information. It is quite similar to the concept of Knowledge Graph. Both tend to help users. For instance, if anyone searches for ‘Rampage,’ He’ll come up with individual entries for Dwayne Johnson, Naomie Harris, Malin Akerman, Jake Lacy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and some other stuff related to his search. Now, every single entry links to another page with more specific information on each cast. Let’s say, the biography, the career, the rewards and the list is endless. Principally, it’s another doorway that makes the Knowledge Graph more influential – while making it less likely, users need to visit external websites to find the information they’re eyeing for.</p>
<h1>Videos and Content</h1>
<p>Search engines like GOOGLE, YAHOO, and BING offer text-based and visual content which people is searching for.
