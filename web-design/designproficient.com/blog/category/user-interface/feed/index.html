				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>UX Design</h1>
<p>UX design refers to the user experience design which means to provide the better and enhanced visual experience to all customers. The user experience design helps in interacting with a person, product, application, and operating system.</p>
<p>It provides a secure and comfortable customer-friendly experience in quickly and smoothly navigating through a website in an organized way for customers. It makes website navigation much simplified to have more dwell time and less bounce rate with an increased click-through rate. It helps users in finding a website usable and accessible.</p>

<h1>04 Elements of User Experience Design</h1>
<h2>Interaction design</h2>
<p>Interaction design is an essential element of user experience design which has a primary focus on creating engaging interfaces and understanding about the flow of communication between users and technology. The significant areas of interaction design are the design, human-computer interaction (HCI), and software development. It also works with the five dimensions of words, visual representation, physical object, time, and behavior.</p>
<h2>Visual design</h2>
<p>The visual design aims to deliver a clear-cut message to the audience by using optical elements such as colors, images, and symbols. It helps represents the better dynamic look and feel of the front-end user interface and also known as graphic design, user interface design, and the communication design.</p>
<h2>Information architecture</h2>
<p>Information architecture is a user experience design element and helps in systemizing and organizing valuable contents for a website. It makes more accessible for a user to navigate through a site and find the proper functionality of a website structure.</p>
<h2>User experience research</h2>
<p>User experience research is a thorough analysis of user behaviors, needs, and their requirements. It requires a detailed process of task analysis and customer feedback. The UX research covers a wide range of usability analysis and quantitative measurements for a better ROI.</p>
<h1>User Interface Design</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">User Interface design</a> primarily refers to the front end visual elements of a website or an app. It helps in giving the wonderful aesthetic sense to the user in interacting and communicating with a site. The perfect user interface design provides a series of colorful interactive screen pages with buttons, icons, checkboxes and drop-down lists. It leaves a profound dynamic, lasting impression on the user to give them a pleasing experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Elements of User interface design</h1>
<h2>Navigational elements</h2>
<p>The navigational elements comprise components which help in easy navigation of a website such as breadcrumbs, menus, filters, links, slider, search field, pagination, tags, and icons.</p>
<h2>Informational elements</h2>
<p>The informational elements consist of a progress bar, notifications, message boxes, tooltips, and icons.</p>
<h2>Input control</h2>
<p>The input control includes check boxes, radio buttons, drop-down lists, list boxes, buttons, toggles, text field, and date field.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In the modern web design, both UX and UI are necessary factors in giving a better visual interface look and dynamic functionality of a website with interaction to users. The UX and UI are inter-related terms to each other, and one doesn&#8217;t work without the other.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us spend more than two hours online every day using different devices with screens that require near exclusive attention where more than trillion websites and the same quantity of mobile apps are battling for our valuable time and attention. To make sure you achieve maximum attention of people in your website or app, The Web Founders has selected some crucial tactics or advices to make you stand out from the rest with your exceptional interface.</p>
<p>So, let’s drive&#8230;</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/24/change-brand-web-based-social-media-image-utilizing-design/">HOW TO CHANGE YOUR BRAND WEB-BASED SOCIAL MEDIA IMAGE UTILIZING DESIGN?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>1.    BE CAREFUL WITH NEW UI PATTERNS</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/design/10-quick-tips-for-uiux-design/">Do not make your audience to think too hard about the interface elements</a>. Most of the elements are already known to users. By this I meant, CTA should look like CTA, Links should look like links and so on.</p>
<p>There is no need to get too creative with common patterns or designs. It might sound exciting to do something out of the box or unique with them, but that does not mean usable. Usability and creativity need to be well-adjusted.</p>
<h1>2.    BE CAREFUL ABOUT SIMPLICITY</h1>
<p>It takes no longer than five seconds for users to judge your website, or whether they’re interested or not, so just be careful about what you want users to do on your site. Consider things that help you to make it easy to use. For the respective purpose, prefer consistent design, it is more straightforward or familiar for visitors because it reprocesses constituents, shades, and aesthetic to lessen the requirement for visitors to rethink.</p>
<h1>3.    BE DIRECT AND STAY HONEST</h1>
<p>By staying honest with yourself and visitors, you can convey your message with confidence. Honesty with a user works more than your thinking. So, for this purpose consider social proof instead of just talking about potentials. Nothing will upsurge your conversion as utterly as being honest with the customers.</p>
<h1>4.    COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CUSTOMERS</h1>
<p>Knowing who your users are, is crucial to make the interface most comfortable for them. For this, you have to select the audience relevant to your business. For example, if your website is about stylish chic outfits for women, choose women who want to wear such modern clothes. After targeting the audience, research on them to know their preferences and desires.</p>
<h1>5.    THINK HOW USERS WILL USE YOUR INTERFACE</h1>
<p>Before designing interface, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">you need to see how visitors will use your website or interface.</a> People landing on your site use it in two ways:</p>
<p>Directly: interacting with the elements of the product.</p>
<p>Indirectly: interacting with an element external to the product.</p>
<h2>Instances of direct interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Taking a card</li>
<li>Tapping a button</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping an item with a fingertip</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instances of indirect interactions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using key commands and shortcuts</li>
<li>Indicating and clicking with a mouse</li>
<li>Drawing on a Wacom tablet</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>6.    SET EXPECTATIONS</h1>
<p>Most of the interactions – directly or indirectly – have some consequences and sometimes, also anxiety. But, you can eliminate this anxiety of users by allowing your users know what will happen just after clicking that particular button before they do it. You can do this through thoughtful design. Highlight the CTA button with appropriate color that has strong meaning. Like we all know green is for a ‘go’ and red for ‘stop.’ You can also use widely understood symbols in a blend with the copy.</p>
<h1>7.    GIVE RESPONSE—FAST</h1>
<p>We are living in a world where environment gives us feedback or respond to our every action. Do you remember to know the stimulus and response theory? The theory implicates here &#8212; We speak, and others respond, or they speak, we respond.</p>
<p>When it comes to your website make sure it all happens quick. Any delay over 2-second mark as an interruption and more than that is enough to cause a bounce. So make your site fast and remove all unnecessary barriers for your users.</p>
<h1>8.    RECOGNITION TO RECALL</h1>
<p>This principle is psychological, suggests, if you have many choices, it is not that hard for you to recognize something already known. Recognition principle should be used wisely to make an experience more comfortable for users. The challenge with recognition is to give users familiar elements which they have been exposed to earlier, instead of expecting them to have a creative idea.</p>
<h1>END OF THE LINE</h1>
<p>So, these are some of tips we have gathered from different sources and experts. Hopefully, they will work for your website..</p>

<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong> Eliminate Adobe flash things</strong></h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have too much Adobe flash on your site, then try to get rid, immediately. Adobe flash is not handy and is inaccessible on many Apple devices. Apple users cannot open sites created with flash. Removing flash enables you to save plenty of customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong> Mobile-Responsiveness</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are living in the era of smartphones where we consume digital media more via mobile phones rather than the desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore it is essential for a site to be mobile responsive too. As, no one wants to spend precious time on your site on scrolling up and down or zooming in and out, especially if people have other options.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a strong relationship that exists between your site ranking and site’s responsiveness. So try to make your website more mobile-responsive through the smart use of coding and grids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong> Strong UI/UX</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the designers build complex designs just to ensure if their site looks different from others. But they end up with poor UI designs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">The poor UI designs are difficult to navigate,</a> and even users become discontented as they need more time for task performing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://conversionxl.com/blog/first-impressions-matter-the-importance-of-great-visual-design/">Strong UI and UX depend on the aesthetic appearance</a>, fast-page loading, and the relevant content. Check if your site is easy-to-navigate and if not then try to add things that ease the visitors to navigate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong> Clear information</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are so busy in creating a unique and innovative site that they forget to focus on the basics. Visitors want to know; who are you, what you are providing, and how you solve their problems. If visitors do not find their answers on your site, they switch to another site. Therefore, you should work on the mentioned basics to make your visitors happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2><strong> Free your site from Clutters</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one of us would like a mess; whether it is a messy room or cluttered website. Sites with an irrelevant and unorganized content are cutter and difficult to understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avoid below-mentioned things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Too much text and visual content on the screen</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Unorganized Content</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Visual noise of striking imagery and contrasts</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removing unnecessary texts, visual content, and visual noise of images from the site are necessary to, upgrade the site, satisfy the visitors or to increase conversion rates. It is evident that sites with the clean user interface are winning in e-commerce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The things mentioned above might sound ok for the designer, but they bother the visitors. People always judge your site aesthetically and with relevancy. So upgrade your site and improve above-mentioned things.</p>

<h1>Grid Free Designing</h1>
<p>Most designers are taught to follow a system of grids for designing to generate alignment and a proper structure. Have you ever thought of designing without grids? Many designers will say NO to this question.</p>
<p>The grid system actually bounds you into a confined structure that never let you to be creative. Grid-free designing is now getting popularity because customized designs can be generated with full freedom.</p>
<h2>Mixing Horizontal and vertical sliding</h2>
<p>Usually, the whole structure of the<a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/blog/45-horizontal-websites-showcase/"> website is vertical or horizontal.</a> The slides of images either go right to left or move up &amp; down. Playing with both x and y-axis at a time can also be a great idea. Though the execution of the design is a little bit difficult but a true artist knows how to handle that all.</p>
<p>It can be highly creative and attractive for fashionable products that some stuff is moving horizontally while some is moving up and down.</p>
<h2>Bright Colors</h2>
<p>Many times designers are afraid of using bright colors because they believe that sharp colors will give a harsh look to their design and the design may look cheap as well. Their thoughts are right to some extend but this issue can be catered by making hash colors complementing with other colors. Use of bright colors along with soft palettes can soothe the sharp effect of any color. You can also play with shades and tones to generate an appealing look of your design.</p>
<h2>Layout of Photos</h2>
<p>Usually designers layout their images into some patterns. This looks really organized and synchronized. But what if you place them without any layout. They will still look great and can spark up your design. Unorganized images can allow the human eye to stay more to figure out what is actually going within the design. They keep the curiosity factor alive in a design.</p>
<p>You can try these hacks for mockups or practice designing. The best way to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">explore new techniques</a> is to design and ask other people to rate your work. This can be great fun. You can understand the small clinches that become hindrances between you and creativity.</p>

</ul>
<p>Color harmony is one of the most integral part of a website design. <a href="https://designproficient.com/web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Every website designer uses a specific color that describes the company’s profile</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Originally derived by Google, material deign is a fusion of “material” elements, minimalistic classic design, micro interactions and customized user experiences all intricately fused together. It is a standard that allows web content to smoothly occupy various digital spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Read Also: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/09/19/logo-design-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">These Logo Design Mistakes Are Ruining Your Business</a></strong></p>
<p>With the flexibility to expand, contract, layer and stack on a wide range of screen sizes without effecting the flow of animations and typographical elements. Material design has become a great way to ensure a future proof contributor to the ever growing web. It basically allows web content to flow in synchronization with various screen sizes that offers the user experience to be without any glitches. Following is a list of components used in material design:</p>
<h2><strong>Comprehensive Visual Cues.</strong></h2>
<p>Material design operates with a number of visual cues, a great example of this is the dog eared page corner which signifies that you can turn, or rotate the current page or text.</p>
<h2><strong>Extremely Flexible.</strong></h2>
<p>Being built within the space of tactile reality, material design can transform into multiple shapes and grow or shrink within its plane. However it cannot exist where there is already another material exists.</p>
<h2><strong>Being highly interactive.  </strong></h2>
<p>Material design allows users to move, manipulate, re-order, and reveal content with ease. Having multiple layers and elements within one space, the design works seamlessly allowing users to see what’s available and helps to narrow down their search requirements.</p>
<h2><strong>Filled with Bold Graphics.</strong></h2>
<p>Bold graphics offer a direct sense of purpose without any kind of misinterpretation. Being flexible with bold graphics allows users to comfortably work with high quality elements across different screen resolutions, platforms and devices.</p>
<h2><strong>Smooth Navigation.</strong></h2>
<p>Material design can be manipulated in a way which can allow users to have full navigation control and the way the content is displayed.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly a breakthrough in the way we experience the World Wide Web, material design has made the online experiences seem like a walk in the park which definitely makes the value of material design timeless. It is fair to say that the use of material design will be seen across the internet in the years to come.</p>
<p>Web developers and designers all acknowledge the true value and impact material design has on all websites. After all said and done, the true importance of material can only be experienced firsthand and when we talk about material design being future proof, the crucial significance that material design has on a website speaks for itself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>User Interface (UI) Defined:</strong></p>
<p>In the language of computing, User Interface (UI) is all what is incorporated into an electronically &amp; digitally operated device for an individual to interact with at all levels seamlessly. The User Interface comprises of input channels such as keyboard, keypad, mouse &amp; soft-keys while display screens and desktop appearance account for the output channels. Expressing it in different terms, it may be regarded as a means of creating interaction between the user and a <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website </a>or mobile application.</p>
<p><strong>Significance Attached to User Interface (UI) Designing:</strong></p>
<p>Owing to ever-increasing dependence on web applications/software &amp; mobile applications, a major chunk of organizations on global scale, as we know of today, have been obligated into setting User Interface as their top priority, in an attempt to improve and provide optimum user experience. Consequently, agencies responsible for developing User Interface of varied types are spending hefty amounts on their Research &amp; Development departments with the intention of coming up with interfaces designed such a way that prove to be an absolute delight to their users. In order that maximum utility levels are achieved by users coupled with the all-time experience of swift computing &amp; smart mobility, with the consumers falling under any age, class, territory, gender or qualification criteria. In the race against user-friendliness, the developers of User Interface are loading new &amp; crisp features into their designing with each passing day.</p>
<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2017/08/24/custom-web-design-best-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Custom Web Design Is The Best Choice For Your Business</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>User Experience (UX) Defined:</strong></p>
<p>User Experience (UX), a term used in conjugation with its parent term, User Interface (UI), is referred to as the outcome a consumer undergoes while getting hands-on with digital tools &amp; devices. The User Experience can best be calibrated via following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The display &amp; desktop appearance of the device, catching the user’s eye at the first go</li>
<li>The response time with which the user switches and swaps in between apps, enabling simultaneous operations &amp; multitasking</li>
<li>The overall content accompanying all computer software &amp; mobile applications, aiding users in a step-by-step mode</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance Attached to Correlation Between User Interface (UI) &amp; User Experience (UX):</strong></p>
<p>What they say appears to be quite true that the simpler it is, the better it is. Evaluating with the perspective of a user, the need for designing &amp; crafting user-friendly interface running on sophisticated backend systems can well be understood. Meeting and keeping up to the consumers’ demands &amp; expectations is what User Experience encompasses. After all, it does make sense that such exorbitant investments put into its research &amp; development are able to pay off dividends only when it is embraced by the masses instantly. With so many choices lined up before the consumers, they would certainly not let be done away with their right to choose. Feedbacks with regards to the User Interface (UI) go a long way in fetching modifications &amp; advancements that spur the user experience into a pleasant and gratifying arena. It is quite understandable that a simpler, smarter interface equates well with better earnings, greater savings &amp; a stable goodwill.</p>
