				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever we go to any site, we have a goal in mind. To achieve that goal, we usually need to take a series of action, and by clicking call to action button, the first step starts to begin. CTA buttons on your site allow you to guide site visitors towards goal conversion. Some of the famous CTA button examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for the newsletter</li>
<li>Want more information</li>
<li>Get the details</li>
<li>Start a Trial</li>
<li>Download the app/book/guide</li>
</ul>
<p>The main goal of CTA button is to draw readers’ attention through its compelling design, indulging stories, and other things.</p>
<p>So here are few design techniques to do for better CTA button:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/04/10/5-subtle-metrics-make-destroy-website/">5 SUBTLE METRICS THAT COULD MAKE OR DESTROY YOUR WEBSITE</a></p>
<h1>1.    Visually Striking Button</h1>
<p>The color matters whether it is your website or your CTA button. Consider your CTA button as it is the only way to stand out among your peers with giving those buttons appealing colors and prominence. I would suggest you to use contrasting colors to create those striking buttons stand out. With contrast colors also use negative space around it to separates CTA buttons from other interface elements.</p>
<h1>2.    Action Oriented Text</h1>
<p><a href="https://masterful-marketing.com/create-a-website-call-to-action-that-converts/">Creating a call to action button that will make your website visitors to take immediate action</a> is a daunting task. Luckily, there are several things you can do to make it outstanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be beneficial for your website if your CTA button begins with a verb. Like, the CTA button “Enter for more information” is less appealing than “Start your free trial.” The difference in between two can be elusive but has different impacts on conversion.</li>
<li>Make sure your CTA button is brief and easy to understand by the users. Keep your button text in between 2-5 words.</li>
<li>When writing your call to action, it is important to incorporate one of these persuasive words: Free, Bonus, and instantly.</li>
<li>Creating a sense of urgency in your call to action buttons can help you in getting extra click-through rates. Like, the call to action button “Sign Up and Get 30% Off Today Only!” is a good example to make individuals want to claim their offer while they can.</li>
</ul>
<h1>3.    Less Is More</h1>
<p>Remember if you want people on your website to take immediate action, you have to guide them properly by eliminating all the existing and potential problems from their way. When people find difficult to use your website or see so many options, they get muddled. So, it is best to offer them only one option.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">if you want to add multiple CTA buttons on your website</a>, give importance to one CTA button to help users to focus on one thing at a time. You can also consider Evernote for this approach.</p>
<p>But, what will happen when your call to action button doesn’t stand out?</p>
<p>I have already mentioned that how important it would be to possess compelling CTA buttons on your website. If you fail to make your CTA button stand out, then you’ll fail to succeed.</p>
<p>Which call to action button is more compelling to make website conversion better is important to know. Keep this in your mind that split-testing alone never tell you this. You have to put your efforts in it.</p>
<p>Give mentioned designs a try and make your CTA button rocket and so increase your website conversion with these buttons.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things like: death, taxes, and a question from people asking ‘So what do you do for a living’ are constant. But some things are not. Like, to give a suitable answer about how it should be a UX designer can be muddling even for many custom product designers.</p>
<p>I have seen so many people dealing with lots of problems in nailing down the answer of how to be a UX designer?</p>
<p>This is what I got from an expert:</p>
<p>“To be a UX designer, it is just like to be inside your users’ brain, to perceive design from the user’s perspective and to resolve expected confusions of users.”</p>
<p>It is like a never-ending route that requires keeping user experience prior more than anything. Though it is challenging to feel like a user, it is not impossible.</p>
<p>To guide your product design and make it bloom, I’ve collected several essential UX principles:</p>

<h1>Product Design Should Be Digestible:</h1>
<p>It would be easy to absorb or digest the product if it is simple and fulfils all the demands of users. You don’t need to spend lots of time or energy to see what things work. Consider all the things that help your product to make it the bottom of the funnel and opt the best one.</p>
<p>Design should be readable and easy to use to make users decide what to do. Users need proper guidelines, and you can do so by maintaining hierarchy and consistency in typography.</p>
<h1>Should Have Clarity:</h1>
<p>Beside things mentioned above, clarity is another thing that adds value to your product. One has to be very clear about his/her product.</p>
<p>With clarity in design, I mean to be very clear about product’s pricing. If users find any difficulty in figuring the price of a product, they’ll probably not buy that product. Therefore, it is important to mention price with ‘buy now’ ticker for better UX.</p>
<p>Making things as clear as possible should be your goal.</p>
<h1>Should Build Trust:</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">It is easy to trust if the design is good.</a> With honesty and clarity in explaining product’s features, one can build trust and increase conversions.</p>
<p>Consider Uber and its stress-free ride service. It is highly successful brand and a perfect example of building trust with consumers.</p>
<h1>Should Possess Familiarity:</h1>
<p>It is good if your product design is ground-breaking, but it should convert better. <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/10-ux-design-predictions-for-2018/">Offering entirely new framework and layout can be a UX killer.</a></p>
<p>Consider all the famous frameworks and layouts. Pay careful attention to each detail and use familiar patterns in your product to give it a native look.</p>
<h1>Should Be User-centric</h1>
<p>Being a product designer, you should have to build a thoughtful product with clear insight and intentions. The respective behavior towards product shows that you care about your users. It is also important as more than 60% of users give up your product just because they think you don’t care about them.</p>
<h1>WRAPPING IT UP</h1>
<p>It is quite easy to make the product as according to the UX canons. All you have to do is be very honest with yourself and perform each action from users’ perspective.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>User Interface and User Experience are the two terminologies that hold the criteria of good or bad designing in the world of websites. The more user-friendly design is, the more benefits it caters. The major reasons for making design simple and easy to make it understandable. Also, people want a website that guides them with necessary points in an easy yet convincing way.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/01/12/3-reasons-2018-year-video-content-engagement/" rel="bookmark">3 Reasons Why 2018 Is the Year for Video Content Engagement</a></p>
<h1>More Views More Sales</h1>
<p>The minimal term refers to simplicity in design. The phenomena of removing all unnecessary and decorative elements to make the website design sophisticated and user-friendly is being the current trend. The reason designers are incorporating it into their work is that consumers are found to view such websites more. More views and more exploration on the website directly lead to more sales.</p>
<p>We can say that<a href="https://usabilitygeek.com/less-is-more-importance-minimalist-web-design/"> minimalism approach in designing</a> can make the process of sales easier and faster and this is all that a company wants.</p>
<h2>Time-Saving for Designers and Developers</h2>
<p>Another benefit of minimalism in web designing is the time-saving factor. The whole process of <a href="https://superdevresources.com/web-design-development-blogs/">designing and development</a> is much easier when with minimalism approach in designing is adopted. Today the ongoing trend is of customized website designing so design houses or individual designers cannot pay hours and hours to one project hence they minimalism provides them ease. The design is functional and easily operated that it is proficient for customers.</p>
<h2>Quick look, Quick Decision</h2>
<p>Previously people use to spend hours on the decorative and extra elements, at that time this approach was fascinating because there were limited websites active for any specific service or product but now the competition is tough and people have a lot of options when they search for anything. In such circumstances people open a website, give it a quick look, if they find it easy going or understandable they pay some time to it otherwise they quickly shift to other websites.</p>
<p>For such quick look, quick decision nature of consumers, it is ideal to present things in a way that they get the brand`s message at first glimpse.</p>
<h2>Highlight what is Important</h2>
<p>As the website has selective things it is easy for designers to bring out important things to the front. The simple tactics like changing the size of the font or adding bright colors to key points grab the attention of viewers quickly. Also, consumers find the specific website, easy to explore because they don’t have to dig out required information from a junk of content. Because it highlights what is most important it actually helps users to operate the website easily and somehow convince them to buy mentioned products or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those were some the reason why we think the minimal <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">design is the future of web UI/UX.</a> The most important point is that audience is loving such designs. For a brand as well as for a designer this is the most considerable point of adopting minimalism design approach in future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of the intricate design techniques that deSignagencies follow these days are time-consuming and complex as they can definitely add a lot of depth and sophistication to a design. Having said that, if they are used in a wrong way, or over used, they tend to create distractions and annoy the viewers from the actual intended emphasis. The easiest and most effect way to have an impactful design is to keep it as simple and minimalistic as possible. In today’s world, simplicity has become the building block for many deSignagencies and individual designers. Here are some basic design techniques that drastically improve the dynamics of any design.</p>
<h2>More contrast.</h2>
<p>Adding more contrasting elements does not mean that it’s overdone. Contrast always attracts more attention and its use has started to gain a lot of popularity in the design world. Using contrast smartly draws audience towards specific elements that require a certain amount attention compared to the rest.</p>
<h2>Gradients.</h2>
<p>Even though advancements in design technologies has allowed the use of gradients to be easily accessible to all designers, its proper use is still considered a difficult art to master. However, the advantages of the impact gradients have on the overall look of a design are undoubtedly noticeable. Listed below are some of the types of gradients that are being used thoroughly by successful designers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal, linear gradient.</li>
<li>Radial gradient.</li>
<li>Diagonal gradient.</li>
<li>Vertical linear fade.</li>
<li>Vertical gradient.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very important to maintain a subtle visual flow at all times when using <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">gradients</a>. This always compliments the overall integrity of the design and helps the rest of the design elements to gel perfectly together.</p>
<h2><strong> </strong>Color<strong>.</strong></h2>
<p>Identifying the right color scheme can be a challenging task but if mastered has a huge impact on any kind of design. However, the over use of colors always tends to draw the attention away from the design. Simply applying a four color pallet is the safest bet for all kinds of designs. Starting with four colors and gradually adding more is a technique used a lot these days by many successful designers.</p>
<h2>Kerning.</h2>
<p>Kerning or letter spacing is a very important skill to be mastered. The perfect letter spacing makes or breaks any kind of design. It plays a very important role in headlines, logos, paragraphs or anything that has text. It’s amazing to notice the impact letter spacing has on a logo design and designers across the globe have started to emphasize significantly more on mastering the skill of perfectly spacing letters in any kind of design.</p>
<h2>Upper and Lower Casing.</h2>
<p>It’s hard to imagine the impact a simple technique like the use of upper or lower case has on a design and yet some amateur designers completely overlook the importance of casing. Typography is completely dependent on the right use of the upper or lower case. It’s what makes or breaks a design, and if the designers have a knack for using the right case then their designs always stand out from the rest.</p>
<p>There you have it. The list of the best or most popular design techniques being used by designers these days. Follow these simple guidelines and you should have no trouble is achieving a great design for yourself or your clients. Good Luck!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a freelance graphic designer, it’s a very common thought to create your own small business by offering design services to multiple clients. However, some designers offer design services as freelancers while others have a full business setup revolving around all design aspects required for their clients. Regardless of the nature of your design services, it is only fair to say that if any kind of design service needs to see growth the company or individual needs to know who they are targeting. Many designers believe that their services cater to everyone but that’s not true, in order to make it available for everyone they will have to use a lot of their <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/logo-design">resources </a>which at the end of the day becomes an unnecessary risk when considering that they can easily just focus on targeting their clientele and in return saving time for producing quality work for their customers. Here are some basic steps that might help in the process of identifying your target market before you start designing.</p>
<h2>Who are they?</h2>
<p>The first thing is to know your target audience thoroughly. What they do, what they like, what they dislike, the type of products they use, what’s their age bracket. If you manage to answer some of these basic questions then be rest assured that you are on your way to chalking out a definite target market. The next step will be to get in-depth research material on your target audience. Further identifying your audience’s needs and requirements.</p>
<h2>Thorough Research.</h2>
<p>It’s not rocket science to find more information about your targeted audience. All the resources are out there to help you to literally know behavior patterns of your audience. Their purchasing habits, their favorite music genres, restaurants, favorite foods, fashion trends etc. All you have to do is use and study the demographics that are provided by most of the top social media platforms. This step is compulsory if you want to obtain and maintain a long lasting relationship with your customers.</p>
<h2>Identifying your next step.</h2>
<p>Once you have thoroughly identified and studied your targeted audiences, you now have to lock down how you’re going to satisfy your customer’s needs, what are the design elements you’re going to have to use that will help in leaving you with happy customers. Get into the details, chalk out the type of fonts your audience will appreciate, the color schemes that they find most attractive. This also allows you to throw in the element of surprise which always helps in getting more attention. Get comfortable with the knowledge that you have gained and start thinking of creative ways to execute the knowledge that you have acquired.</p>
<h2>Start Designing!</h2>
<p>At this point you should have all the information and research required to allow you to start putting your creative design ideas on paper, tailor made for your audience. You should know exactly what kind of design basics are required, like the typeface, color scheme, typography etc. Now is the time for you to bring out the designer in you and go crazy with it. Use the information about your audience in the most creative way possible and let your designing skills take over.</p>
<p>There you have it. Use the above basic guidelines and rest assured to have a design that will definitely please and cater to your audiences’ needs to the fullest. Good Luck!</p>
