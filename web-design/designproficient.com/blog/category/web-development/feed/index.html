				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to choosing a framework for your website or for <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web"><strong>web development</strong></a> many developers prefer to choose PHP Frameworks for their projects. There are a lot of PHP Frameworks are present among the unique choices but Laravel and Symfony are unique and most popular among all. Developers seem to be choosing these frameworks mostly and frequently.</p>
<p>Now here comes a common question that we cannot use both at a time and we need to make choice between two of them and to work with one framework. Both frameworks can have pros and cons. And by keeping all these in mind developers select a proper framework for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Have an Individual Look Over Both Frameworks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Laravel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Laravel launches in the year 2011.</li>
<li>Its current running version is 5.8</li>
<li>It has long term support</li>
<li>Its licenses are available free for commercial use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Laravel is an open-source PHP framework and it is built especially for Model View Controller web applications. It offers tools for HTML templates, provides simple interaction with databases, provides tools for MVC applications, and many other services. For Laravel, you need to have an advance and heavy knowledge of core PHP and Advance PHP. For developing a simple PHP application Laravel is well known as it requires simple coding and reduces the time for development.</p>
<p><strong>Symfony:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Symfony launches in the year 2011.</li>
<li>Its current running version is 4.2</li>
<li>It has long term support.</li>
<li>Its licenses are available free for commercial use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Symfony is an enterprise-level PHP web application framework that comprises of latest technologies of the web. It consists of a set of a recyclable decoupled PHP Framework over which developers can develop some of the PHP apps. Symfony has been rising as the more trustable and mature framework. It is mainly used to develop large and complex projects for enterprises and corporates.</p>
<p><strong>The similarity between Laravel and Symfony </strong></p>
<p>Both frameworks are from PHP so they comprise some similarities in them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Both support multi-user facilities and multi-language content.</li>
<li>They both are considered as cross-platform in nature and as they use multi computing platforms.</li>
<li>Both have extensions and built-in plugins in them.</li>
<li>They are computer software that can be implemented on multi computing platforms as they are cross-platforms.</li>
<li>Laravel and Symfony both are developed on MVC architecture.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let’s Compare Between Their Pros and Cons</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pros of Laravel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Laravel always stays updated with the new version of PHP Features.</li>
<li>It has additional tools that are store in a large echo system.</li>
<li>It has a high level of compatibility with third-party platforms and libraries.</li>
<li>Through API it allows different apps and popular email services to get integrated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros of Symfony:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Symfony community is one of the biggest in the market, as a huge amount of developers are using it actively.</li>
<li>Symfony is used by well-known platforms like Magento, Drupal, so this framework is a good recommendation for these platforms.</li>
<li>To cope up with the needs of developers, Symfony is updating regularly to keep every little detail up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons of Laravel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For small screens, Laravel is not so suitable, as some applications that are built over this so they are heavier for faster loading.</li>
<li>The compatibility level for updates in Laravel is not so good, you can make it compatible with update all you need to break the code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>       Cons of Symfony:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Symfony is harder to learn as compare to other PHP Frameworks at the beginning.</li>
<li>Loading of some applications must be low, as it depends on other technologies. Origin elements are lack in Symfony.</li>
<li>It requires more time for testing and result, as we need to rebuild code for multiple uses, and due to this development process is low.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here Is a Little Comparison at The End for Both Languages:</strong></p>
<p>After reading this blog you can decide easily either Laravel or Symfony is best for your upcoming project.</p>
<p>Database support margin of both languages: both languages offer Object Relation Mapping for accessing data. Simpler data manipulation is offered by ORM in both of these frameworks.</p>
<p>Databases that are supported by either one or both of these languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>MySql is supported by both of them.</li>
<li>Drizzle is supported by Symfony only.</li>
<li>They both support SQL Server.</li>
<li>Oracle and SAP Sybase SQL Anywhere are supported by Symfony only.</li>
<li>They both support SQL Lite.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we keep database support of these languages, we can see that Symfony is supporting more databases rather than Laravel. So if you are going to work on a project that needs data handling or storage you should select Symfony Templet.</p>
<p>So when it comes over the reusability of components and modularity of code Symfony always wins over Laravel. It is depending upon you which Templet you are going to select for your project as both are from PHP and both have strong database support.</p>

Web development is a complex technical field which requires every developer to keep learning new things to increase his proficiency and to hold a solid grasp of expertise in coding and programming websites.</p>
<p>Here are the three modern techniques every web developer should know about:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/08/30/ux-ui-design/">The Difference between UX and UI design</a></p>
<h1>CSS 3 media queries</h1>
<p>Css3 media queries are the fundamental building block elements of a <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">responsive website design</a>. These are syntax command code in a cascading style sheet module used to define set of parameters to modify the desktop screen resolution sizes and mobile browser viewport width.</p>
<p>The CSS3 media queries are used to apply styles with the CSS modules by using the @media and @import at-rules. It is also used to target specific media for the &lt;link&gt;, &lt;source&gt;, and other HTML elements. Moreover, it is further used to test media queries by using the Window.match media () and MediaQueryList.addlistener () JavaScript methods.</p>
<p>Following is the code to illustrate the CSS media queries with example:</p>
<p>@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {</p>
<p>#container {</p>
<p>Width: 320px;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Header h1#logo a {</p>
<p>Width: 320px;</p>
<p>Height: 44px;</p>

<p>Here is the font resizing code with root em:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Html {font-size: 62.5 %;}</p>
<p>Body {font-size: 1.4rem ;} /* =14px */</p>
<p>h1 {font-size: 2.4rem ;} /* =24px */</p>
<h1>Cache pages for offline usage</h1>
<p>Cache manifest is a new feature in the Html 5 web element which helps users to easily visit the website while being offline. It helps in navigating offline web pages with a faster loading speed and reduced load server.</p>
<p>Following is the code for offline cache pages:</p>
<p>Add-Type text/cache-manifest .manifest</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CACHE MANIFEST</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CACHE</p>
<p>index.html</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launching a website is the only half route towards online business, the other half is to bring potential customers to your website and stop the audience from driving away. Many small budget and simple sites can keep customers intact whereas many high budget websites are a total flop. The reason lies within the website design and development.</p>
<p>Here are six ways of driving customers away from a website and if your website is following any such pattern it’s time to change to earn more and more happy customers.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/07/20/make-money-graphic-design/">How to make money as a Graphic Designer?</a></p>
<h1>URL is too complicated or misleading</h1>
<p>Complicated URLs never let the audience find your website while searching something of Google. URLs with numbers or tricky name, confusing spelling considered as least professional or tacky. Misleading URLs also play a role in confusing clients, and they don&#8217;t click BUY NOW button.</p>
<h1>Haphazard Landing Page</h1>
<p>Landing page with incorrect and unclear information is the biggest reason for leaving a website right ahead without checking out further information and company`s message. Landing page image and video are the two best chances to attract visitors and provoke them to visit service page or inventory of any website. When images are unorganized, information is not worthy, and the content is chaotic the visitors leave the site within 10 to 15 seconds.</p>
<h1>Pop-ups</h1>
<p>One or two pop-ups are fine, but too many pop-ups are exasperating and annoying. Useless and irrelevant pop-ups will drag the customer’s attention to something else, and many of them will shift to other <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">websites</a>.</p>
<h1>Grammar Errors in Content</h1>
<p>Grammar errors show the unprofessionalism and non-serious attitude of your company. Write simple and straightforward content with no grammar issues rather than finding quality in complex and long sentences.</p>
<h1>Complex Vocabulary</h1>
<p>No one will pay time to check for synonyms before placing an order on a website that’s why complex and rarely used vocabulary will only irritate people by not letting them understand your message. With poor message deliverance, the chances of getting good business are not possible.</p>
<h1>Auto-Music or Video</h1>
<p>Believe it or not auto music and video is a real pain. Firstly, out of nowhere something starts to play no matter you want to watch it or not. Secondly, it increases loading time, and in case of slow internet people can’t scroll or check other pages because of auto pay mode. Usually among multiple tabs, if something unnecessarily starts playing something people without giving a single look to website close that particular tab.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard the saying, Content is fire; web design is its fuel? If so, you must know the importance of content is as same as the design of a site is. A content that is not unique, fresh, genuine, as per your customers’ preferences cannot give any benefit to you. Holding the gigantic significance, unique content is something you cannot overlook its importance in catching numerous eyeballs from people coming from different rivalries. Unique content is original and not duplicated anywhere else.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h1>Unique Content Can Educate People about Your Professional Website</h1>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Content is a resource of information which can be used to educate search engines about what your business caters to and how unique you are. It is important to bear in mind your website is depicted to search engines and must have to communicate your website’s purpose accurately. Try to optimize your website and permit search engine to know when to show your site in the results for appropriate search queries.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Unique Content Can Help You Raise in Search Engine</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keywords are considered to be essential for ranking. Keywords refer that you are looking for online prominence and that best define your products and services. Content should always reflect your keyword strategy. Content is a great place to highlight the relevant keywords in a natural, harmonious way and to support search engines make the connection between the keywords and your website that you have incorporated in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2>Unique Content Can Help You with Social Validation</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The importance of customers in business progress is undeniable. Earning their trust is essential to get that mark you always dream of. In chasing this dream, you have to give them the thing they want more from you: Social validation. I have seen numerous web pages and blog posts ranking well due to the social validation. This can be attained by trial and error method and lots of consideration. For business ranging from small to medium-sized business, the only way you can get social validation is by the quality and unique content writing.</p>
<p><strong>So, How To Write A Unique And Appealing Content?</strong></p>
<p>Here are few guidelines to incorporate in your writing style:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never steal a word from other resource. Stay away from plagiarism by citing research and using your own words to explain the topic.</li>
<li>Do not stick on one resource. Better to use multiple sources when researching.</li>
<li>Give your text a unique structure.</li>
<li>Incorporate your individual style.</li>
<li>Keep reliance on your rational thinking. Explain things how you comprehend them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>LAST THOUGHT</u></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">When your content is high in quality</a>, it delivers value. When your content provides people with what they are on the lookout for, they lean towards to engage with your content through numerous means. And this is how your content will earn it&#8217;s acknowledged and helps your website raise in search engine results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.webvanta.com/post/2014-08-04/10-tips-for-creating-websites-that-are-easy-to-maintain">Writing for a custom website is not a piece of cake</a>. If not done wisely, can ruin the complete persona of your website. No matter what and how your web design is making a striking impression by its appearance, the content writing is also worthy of remark. The content of your site should be readable, graspable and appealing to the readers. In this way, the conversational style works best. You have to destroy jargon, avid obscure acronyms, use active voice more, and set goals for your web content.</p>
<p>For your convenience, I’ve gathered some of the useful writing prescriptions for the web. So, scroll through:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/05/02/4-ways-developing-effective-brand-identity/">4 WAYS TO DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE BRAND IDENTITY</a></p>
<h1>1.    Start with setting the Tone</h1>
<p>There are two important things to give importance before explaining the appropriate tone of your site. Your target audience and what your website is aiming to achieve. So, start with asking &#8212; who’s your target audience? How old are they? Where they live? What values do they give importance to? Most importantly, what their preferences are? And about website, is it an e-commerce website? Is it about educational purpose?</p>
<p>Your audience and your professional website,<a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web"> both are important when it comes to writing content on your site</a>. By knowing your audience precisely you may craft writing relevant to their interest in your site.</p>
<h1>2. Be professional AND human</h1>
<p>Try to avoid adding too much marketing jargon. By doing this, you are isolating yourself, as people don’t feel like they’re being sold. In this age, we are surrounded by a number of ads. Find out the appropriate way to present your business clearly, without losing your human face. Even, I also believe that people respond more quickly and better when they can see the professional man in front of him.</p>
<h1>3. Be concise</h1>
<p>You will be wonder to know that average attention span of a web user is not more than 7 seconds. By this, it meant that you have to make these limited time appealing enough to attract more eyeballs. It’s better to be creative and smart. But, everything is good if it remains in accord. Give your people the information they want before they lose their interest in your writing and head back to Google.</p>
<p>Being a writer, your aim should be and must be to avoid unnecessary or needless words in a sentence. Unnecessary words result in idleness.  You can achieve efficiency in your writing by using precise and concise words or phrases that denote some strong meaning and have power. The easy way to do so is to write everything you want and then eliminate those words from a context or sentence which you think are not contributing much. In other words, if a word can be eliminated from a text without affecting its meaning, it should be removed.</p>
<h1>4.    Use short words Use short sentences Use short paragraphs</h1>
<p>Do not go for long and complicated sentences. Shorter sentences are better than the longer ones. In fact, the short sentence is better because in this way there&#8217;s less risk of grammatical mistakes.</p>
<h1>5.    Focus on headlines</h1>
<p>Headling or titles that contain amazing adjectives are more likely to attract a lot more likes. On the other hand, if you see content with less-compelling headlines not get more clicks or retweets. So, try to incorporate highly-persuasive adjectives into your headlines.</p>
<p>So, these are some of the most important writing prescription for the web. I hope you like my blog!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">Responsive design is becoming a need for a professional web deSignagency</a>. Because, it can solve a lot of problems – will improve the way your website looks on devices, make your site user-friendly, and make the users spend more time on website. In fact, it can help you improve your site ranking in search engines. Unfortunately, most of the brands don’t know that more than half of the users on a website are from mobile. However, the percentage of mobile users will continue to grow in coming few years. If your company’s website is not responsive, then here are few best practices you can do to make it responsive for both- desktop and mobile users.</p>
<p>Here is the list of things you can do to make responsive professional website:</p>

<h1>ADAPTABLE ON ALL DEVICES</h1>
<p>Responsive design is something that fits on all type of the devices: desktop, mobile, and tablet. One can deliver a great experience through it. I already mentioned that mobile responsiveness is essential ranking factor. In fact, it is a first step in creating a responsive web page that fulfils the demands of its users. For true responsive design, every element of a website’s markup should be context-aware and balance with the screen.</p>
<h2>INTUITIVE NAVIGATION</h2>
<p>Intuitive navigation is another critical website element to have a responsive and successful website. It means that your site is created in such a way that website traffic streams from web page to web page. On the other hand, website with a poor user experience will undergo from high rates of leaving.</p>
<h2>CONSISTENCY</h2>
<p>Well-Build navigation is not enough. Design consistency is extremely important. Add consistent elements with clear in goals. Try to know about your audience and their expectations. If you know what users expect to do on your site, then you can design for those prospects. Also, keep pages similar, usable and stay consistent with design and content of your website.</p>
<h2>BOLD TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.webydo.com/blog/graphic-design/typography/11-stunning-typography-examples-from-3-surprising-sources/">Typography is a huge topic when it comes to design a responsive website.</a> Being a designer, it’s your responsibility to know for whom you are designing. If you fail to deliver readable text, you’ll end up with poorly designed website. It is crucial to understand the nature of devices, check which typeface is more suitable for a particular device, and check the distance from which your audience will look at displays. Make sure the letters should be stand out from the background. Also, create a visual rhythm of each element with the wise use of a grid.</p>
<h2>USE OF MICRO INTERACTIONS IN WEBSITE</h2>
<p>The use of micro-interactions is one of the most common things web designer thinking as a trend. Micro-interactions are variables that allow a visitor to interact with a website without reloading it. In fact, they’re the fundamental part of website design, that any site without them will probably look bland and uninteresting. Micro-interactions make the user experience much more fun and also save time.</p>
<p>Consider these practices and make your custom website responsive enough to attract more customers.</p>
