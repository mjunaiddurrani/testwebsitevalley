				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If this is the first time that you are hiring a digital marketing agency or changing your current affiliate agency, you need to make serious preparations. You got to start with a history search, build a list of agencies, and determine who will make sales calls.</p>
<p>However, the sales call itself can be a little tricky. An agent’s sales representative may simply sell the product through the service and end up asking for more than necessary. As a company that tries to invest a lot of money in outsourcing, you need to make sure you are talking to the right people. When asking the right questions, you should be able to discuss and understand the important facts that your diligence has not collected.</p>
<p>There is a saying in the marketing world that is correct, but unfortunately, it is widespread. In most cases, however vague, “it depends” is the accurate response to most marketing questions. This saying applies to marketers and customers. Each client has individual needs, and each agency has its own skills. So what if your company is looking for a</p>
<p>that can effectively communicate your goals and values? Before continuing the interview with a potential agency, the following questions will help you determine if the agency is right for you.</p>
<h2>1.What Are The Main Industries You Work With?</h2>
<p>The way they answer that question will determine how far they understand the distinctions of your industry. The more they know the companies in their industry, the faster they can produce results. However, if they do not mention their sector or similar industry, it means that they may not have direct knowledge of the strategies to be applied. This is not an agreement that can solve the problem in all situations, but it is definitely worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Specific marketing procedures can indeed produce excellent results in almost all situations, but different sectors require changed methods. Make sure that the brand organization is able to explain the strategic differences between medical device companies and academia.</p>
<h2>2. What Is Your Agency’s Culture?</h2>
<p>Determining the agency culture you want to work with is imperative for developing honest and long-term relationships with their team. The better the relationship with the agency, the better it will do for you. Visit the agency from time to time (especially the account manager). On average, you find yourself as a group customer 4 to 6 times a year. Make sure they match your business and values. If the agency you are looking for is a person, you need to like that person.</p>
<h2>3. What Do Your Reports Look like?</h2>
<p>Mathematics is a universal language, but not everyone is particularly proficient. If you need reports provided by agencies in a translated form, they are not very good. Good reports are practical and transparent, and the reports themselves need to be translated. A right agency will also explain how to use, maintain, and understand the work you provide, but their work reports must be self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Another critical factor in the agency’s report is time. The frequency with which they report to other customers is a good indication of the frequency with which they report to you. The “good” timings depend on your needs. For example, do you need to receive a report before a particular day to receive the bonus, or do you just try to send and receive reports once a year to reduce confusion?</p>
<h2>4. Can You Manage Our Social Media Platforms?</h2>
<p>Your business should try to find an agency that uses existing marketing strategies to serve your target audience. Many consumers expect social media analytics, insights, and a company’s overall appeal before making a purchase decision. To be kept informed, you need to use social media platforms actively. Ask the potential agency about the latest plans for your social media and connect your company’s brand to your followers. Find out if they have a content strategy and how to use it across all social media platforms.</p>
<h2>5. Does Your Company Offer Web Design Services?</h2>
<p>A company needs to have a website that performs efficiently on both PCs and mobile devices. Ask your agency how to make your site respond to multiple devices and how long it takes to get results. It can also be useful to ask your agency about other sites that they have created for you and see what the agency is doing.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that the agency uses the website template or custom design created by each website. Ask how much your company is investing in the design and layout of your website and any concerns you may have, such as pop-up surveys or adding security features to your website.</p>
<h2>6. What Is Your Most Successful Project Till Date</h2>
<p>Customer testimonials and case studies are social evidence that <strong><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">experienced digital marketing agencies</a></strong> should get on their websites. However, if you see them, you don’t have to stop there. It would be best if you asked some follow-up queries to close the loopholes. If you can’t find social evidence on their website or what they have don’t relevant to your work, ask the agency to show how they can help you. If the agency is newly established, it must have the best portfolio on its website for referrals from future clients.</p>
<h2>7. How Much Would This Project Cost And What Is The Fee Structure?</h2>
<p>Before the agency starts anything, the cost of the project must be determined. Ask your agency about the fees and total cost of creating a project in an hour, as well as other costs, such as maintaining a website and stock photos. Let’s take it one step closer, what happens when a project exceeds your budget, and when you have to pay an agent. When asking these questions, remember to take your budget with you.</p>
<p>How do agency charges? Will you charge an hour for a fixed price, or will I be charged whenever a new user is assigned to a task? You should ask about any hidden fees that may be incurred by the agency. In addition to the average price range, it is important to take seriously how they view your success and how it compares to your salary.</p>
<h2>8. When Have You Failed?</h2>
<p>This is an important question but often overlooked when hiring any agency. While asking about examples of their work, you want to see at least one example of a failed project or ask them when they failed. By not learning, exposing the mistakes of the past and the ways they learned from them revealed the true “agility” and “adaptability” of the agency.</p>
<h2>9. How Does Your Company Utilize Content?</h2>
<p>It would be best if you had an agency that can create content that conveys the image of your business through numerous channels. The blog contains keywords that your company’s target users are looking for to help increase traffic to your site. Print and digital advertising, TV advertising, email marketing, and online video are also effective strategies for leveraging content creation. Ask the agency how they plan to share the content and how often they make new content.</p>
<h2>10. What Is The Project Timeline?</h2>
<p>Ask your agency the actual time of the proposed project. Ask them how they contact your company and how you can connect with your potential agency. In addition, the agency should be able to explain to you the project process you have submitted and how they intend to measure the results of the project.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Choosing an agency as a digital marketing partner for your brand is not a quick and easy process. There are many options, many different styles, and many potential consequences (good and bad) in the business that you may face as a result of your decision. When asking potential agency, the questions described in this article will help you better understand the digital marketing agency you are looking for and your own goals and preferences. After all, the choice is yours, so consider your choice carefully.</p>

<h1>Robots.txt and XML sitemap</h1>
<p>The robots.txt is Meta source file which has a purpose of restricting the bots to crawl the specific pages in your website. XML sitemap provides the fast crawling and indexing of your website pages to let know Google about them. These files do not affect your ranking of the website but are essential factors for SEO.</p>
<h1>Meta keywords</h1>
<p>Meta keywords are the generic list of HTML keywords which help to show up ranking for your website.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All businesses today strive to increase the profit margin in order to smoothly manage and run their operations, expand services and offer a comparative advantage to the customers. However, this is easier said than done, especially in today’s modern and fast paced world where competition is tough.</p>
<p>Successfully aligning both the sales and marketing teams within a company is a practice which is as old as the entire corporate structure itself. For numerous companies, the marketing department’s job is to generate successful leads and the sale’s team’s job to turn them into loyal customers.</p>
<p>According to theory, it is important that both the marketing alongside the sales teams, work in tandem, to align shared goals as well as roles to ensure ROI becomes the responsibility or the organization, rather than that of individual teams.</p>
<p>Unluckily, building a solid team around marketing and sales alignment is usually easier said than done. Nevertheless, here are 5 brilliant ideas using which you can effectively implement an amazing strategy and make sure everyone keeps and works towards common goals and targets.</p>

<h1>Determine the Company’s Marketing Goals</h1>
<p>Even though this might sound a little cliché, but it is advised that you “Plan your work, and work your plan.” Developing a strategic plan is going to help your organization go a long way towards getting off to a very good start. When you are determining the marketing goals, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What new products and/or services will I be launching this year?</li>
<li>What is the overall revenue goal for this year?</li>
<li>What key metrics are extremely important when it comes to measuring my sales and marketing success?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Reduce Your Expenses</h1>
<p>One of the tried and tested ways using which you can bring up your sales is by reducing your expenses. For examples, you may want to consider having shared offices instead of having your own expansive and expensive space. Keep a track of your account books and identify where your money is going. After analyzing this, look for various different ways to reduce all the expenses incurred without actually compromising the business.</p>
<h1>Improve Your Customer Relationship</h1>
<p>You should also be active when it comes to improving your relationship with your clients. Focus on initiating loyalty. When consumers are loyal, you can trust that they will support your products, even when you increase prices, given that the quality remains top-notch. Research about your clients, think about customer segmentation, learn about what they need, and design approaches that will allow you to deliver a high level of consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is very easy to be overwhelmed when it comes to considering all the various different marketing choices and paths accessible to <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">grow your business</a>. Nonetheless, with all signs pointing towards constant economic growth worldwide in the year 2018, there is still time to create a plan to increase revenue this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of text content is usually to communicate with the readers and connect them with information that may help them by any means. However the purpose of SEO content is slightly different from the usual. The kind of content required for search engine optimization has to qualify certain algorithms that Google announces in order to escalate a website’s ranking on the internet. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/seo-services">SEO content is described better as the content which is approved by search engines</a> and has a higher probability of relevance, visibility to right kind of audience and is even more interest gauging.</p>
<p>Writing content is very easy for those who have a passion for writing or are just good with spinning the words. However, writing content for search engine optimization asks for a little more. There are certain things that a writer should keep in his mind while writing content for SEO purpose.</p>

<p>Let us discuss a few below!</p>
<p><strong>Keep your page load low</strong> – According to famous digital marketer and SEO expert, Neil Patel says that 40% of the people withdraw themselves from surfing on a page that takes more than 3 seconds to load. Make sure you craft the pages keeping these stats in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Make powerful and meaningful headlines</strong> – Headlines play an important role for SEO content. First of all your content must include headlines and these headlines should be in correct length and include relevant keywords in them.</p>
<p><strong>Make use of correct CTAs (Call to action)</strong> – <a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/scannable-content/">SEO content must have a few lines that can drive the reader for an action</a>. You can do this by using words like “click, share or comment” at the end of your SEO blog or article.</p>
<p><strong>Address the reader</strong> – The sign of a good content is where the addressee is defined. The reader should be addressed directly throughout the content. This makes your content more engaging and optimizes its readability.</p>
<p><strong>Use of keywords</strong> – A well written content is the one which is backed by intelligent keyword research. A writer should know how to incorporate the picked keywords in their articles and follow the ratio in the content accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid using jargons</strong> – Jargons should not be used in great volume in a content. Try to go easy with words that can conveniently be understood by the readers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No need to mention that if you are running any business, you have to face new challenges to your business and customers. The common problems could be: lacking website traffic, lacking users’ interests, sales funnel deficit, and deprived lead conversion. It is sad to deal with such issues after spending much time, money and considerations to the business.</p>
<p>The good news is that the use of several marketing tactics can help you solve these problems across the board. With its flexibility helps you <a href="https://www.intechnic.com/blog/how-to-set-smart-business-goals-for-a-business-website/">make improvements and reach the goals that you have set earlier for your business</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dig more in-depth at the common business problems and how marketing can play a significant role in problem-solving.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/12/5-unsung-myths-marketing/">5 UNSUNG MYTHS ABOUT MARKETING</a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Content Marketing Campaign</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Fresh, new, genuine content is like a fuel for your business. It can work to resolve many of the issues that your business is facing and presents you with a chance to position your business in the center of your target audience. If the content is compelling, interesting and on the recent topics, it can earn more attention. The user-centric is the only things which you cannot take as an optional. Write a genuine and fresh blog or web content relevant to your business. Make your content highly-relevant to your potential readers’ preferences. Understand their opinions and think about their likes and dislikes before writing any content. The headlines and titles get more attention and require more consideration.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Properly Optimized Web Content</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After preparing the content, get all your attention towards optimization. Proper optimization is a need. Incorporate relevant keywords into the content. Here, you cannot go recklessly. You have to be very wise and responsible about what keywords should be added on a content. For this, research thoroughly your audience about what word(s) they will use to search you on the search engine. Incorporate them into your content. However, do not use more than three or four keywords in one webpage. Exceed can be harmful, and even Google can penalize you for misusing keywords. So, be very careful.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Short and Long Tail Keywords</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This point is the extension of the second one, but I am writing this separately to emphasizing more. Keywords are king for any content, and the importance of them cannot be neglected. There are two types of keywords: Short-tail keywords and Long-tail Keywords. Short-tail keywords are search maxims with one word, whereas long-tail keywords are phrases with three-four words. Which type is more productive, is crucial to understand. According to SEO experts, the use of Long-tail keyword is more common, and so it should be incorporated into content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Social Media Network</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/social-media-marketing">Having a social media presence helps you achieving more business recognition and customers</a>. In fact, social media is like a breeding ground which should be used wisely. Business owners, sometimes, lack users’ interests and find it difficult to get more conversion. Here in such situation, the platform helps you by providing you more recognition with the help of its 2.8 billion active users.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Email Marketing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>With the technological advancement and social media presence, it seems like the use of email is decreasing. However, still, email marketing has its own importance when it comes to solving common problems your business face, such as sales funnel insufficiency and poor lead conversion. This type of marketing helps you a lot. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or ask sales or contributions, and is meant to build devotion, faith, or brand awareness. It is also crucial for building relationships with prospects, leads, and new customers as it gives you a chance to communicate directly to them and convince, in their inbox, at a time that is suitable for them.</p>
<p>Finally, I would say that one who knows even little about the marketing industry cannot refuse the significance of it. The industry is booming and getting more authority on each successive day. In fact, the future also seems more prosperous.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a single person living in this digital era can say ‘NO’ to the importance of Marketing. <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">Marketing is compulsory for any business</a>. It is something through which you can make your product well-known in the eyes of the people. Not limited to this, the industry is developing on each successive day. Marketing can be referred as a breeding ground that has opened many doors of success not only for business but also for many folks. But, unfortunately, like many industries, this industry also become a prey of irrelevant myths. So, let’s check out some of the important myths of marketing:</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="https://designproficient.com/blog/2018/06/08/simple-introduction-custom-web-design/">A Simple Introduction To Custom Web Design</a></p>
<p>Myth #1: <strong>Customers Take Your Social Posts for granted</strong></p>
<p>It is not true. Customers read your social content and it also can convince and influence their purchasing decisions. The study reveals, “Nearly 70% of B2C companies and 40% of B2B companies have developed their customer base through social networking sites.” It doesn’t matter much what the social network is, any text, video, image, contest or coupon you publish will get countless eyeballs in this breeding ground with 2.2 billion users.</p>
<p>Myth #2: <strong>Marketing Should Define Future Products&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>It is believed that marketing group allegedly has a grip on what consumers want or prefer in a product or services, as characterized by a list of &#8220;market requirements.&#8221;  Though, in many cases, the marketing group doesn&#8217;t know much about customers’ requirements because of the communication gap. Most of the vendors only know about their current accounts think they want in the future.</p>
<p>Myth #3: <strong>Social media Heals Reputation Wounds</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/how-to-market-a-product">Marketing is all about promoting products to make sales</a>. Not taking care about website feedback is not helpful here. Receiving that outraged Rip-off Report is enough to put an end to your business reputation in search engine results. Each word you say matters a lot and cannot be taken back. In case of any problem, make sure that your social media pages possess active administrators authorized to alleviate any problem immediately, individually and systematically. Well, this myth is true at some extent.</p>
<p>Myth #4: <strong>No need to evaluate social success By Communal Interactions</strong></p>
<p>Sales opportunities or profits should measure the ultimate success you get through social interactions. Interactions may also help you with sales opportunities; but, if you don’t close any of those leads, the campaign will be nothing but a disappointment, regardless of how many interactions were bred. Marketing is about drive higher sales in which evaluation is essential to know which strategy is functional.</p>
<p>Myth #5: <strong>Marketing Costs Nothing</strong></p>
<p>The marketing industry is booming on each successive day. The scope and the benefits your business will get are countless. With such broader scope, the industry plays a vital role in creating employment and also fruitful socio-economic progress. Though the use of social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube are all free to use, hidden costs always exist when applying a social media marketing campaign for most customer boost.</p>
<p>For an active and fetching social media promotion, you need an expert who prioritizes and implements the plan, be able to message, and monitors the mediums for customer response. And it is apparent that he will charge heavy bucks for this job.</p>

<h1>Twitter</h1>

<p><strong><em>So, here are some tips:</em></strong></p>
<p>Tip #1: Check out each channel, study them and find out the channel which will work more effectively for your business. Try to consider some of the factors with each channel: The product or service you are offering and the available resources at your disposal. Social media is free, but your time is precious enough to care.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Don’t use every channel or sign up on every platform for just because they’re new in the market or getting popular on the souk. Instead, find out the channel which is most relevant, effective to the business you’ve chosen to appeal your customers.</p>
