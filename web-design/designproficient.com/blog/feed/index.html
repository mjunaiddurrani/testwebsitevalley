				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a crowded market, it is necessary to increase sales, profits, and successful businesses. The basic objective of marketing is to create a brand of products and services. The brand’s needs are not limited to product marketing. A company’s brand can help customers identify long-term effects related to their business. As consumers know in advance the quality, reliability, and purpose of your products, an effective branding campaign can minimize the need for large-scale marketing of each new product.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of all the products we use is due to the brand. This is the link that connects the company to the customer. Branding is a must for all startups, partners, and companies. Thanks to a good brand, it looks simple. In all marketing activities, they were able to convey the essence of the product or company immediately. However, after its simple appearance, we can guarantee that a lot has been invested in the brand identity. This is the foundation of any effective marketing campaign. Let’s take a closer look at why brand identity is important to your business.</p>
<h2>What Is Brand Identity?</h2>
<p>A brand identity is a set of tools that a company uses to create the image of a brand. Brand image is the perception of customers about a brand, which consists of several associations related to the brand image and the interaction of memory with the brand.</p>
<p>The brand image and its elements are due to the company’s mission, the brand’s value proposition, long-term objectives, competitiveness in the market, and the connection between the significance and the interest of the target audience. These elements have essential characteristics, and the branding process explains what the company wants to convey. On the other hand, brand identity shows how these basic elements are transmitted. The most commonly recognized aspects of brand identity are generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand name.</li>
<li>Tagline or slogans.</li>
<li>Color and graphic style.</li>
<li>Logos and word-marks and their distinctions.</li>
<li>Voice and intonation.</li>
<li>Typography and styles.</li>
</ul>
<p>These basics can be grouped in different ways, and there are many opinions about the elements of the brand to be included in this list and their order. These transformations are usually clarified by discussing the brand’s history and the opinions of specific experts.</p>
<p>What better example than the Coca Cola brand? They put the brand at the forefront of their marketing strategy, and the results are well known. At first glance, few people associate or recognize this brand. Now let’s look at some of the main reasons how brand identity can affect your business.</p>
<h2><strong>Branding Helps Recognize Your Products Or Services</strong></h2>
<p>The brand is more than just a tag, logo design, and a collection of stylish slogans. Anything that helps to embrace an organization and differentiate it from other users. For example, a brand can be implemented as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The visual identity of the brand (website, logo, color, etc.).</li>
<li>Marketing and communication.</li>
<li>Product and packaging.</li>
<li>In-store familiarity.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Partnership with sponsors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of the brand as human. Each has its personality, dress, communication style, values, friends, qualities, and stories. They are what make us, and these qualities constitute the brand.</p>
<h2><strong>It Brings More Business </strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Brand-Development">Brand identity</a></strong> is important when you want to expand your existing businesses and create new ones. Well-known brands are easy to identify and can bring more business to a company and thus increase visibility or popularity in a niche market. This makes customers a more attractive option and a unique position to get your business to market.</p>
<h2>It Supports Workforce Satisfaction</h2>
<p>When employees run a high-end company, they are happy and proud of their work. Working with a reputable brand brings high ratings to your employees and makes your business more enjoyable and satisfying. A branded workplace allows employees to feel more satisfied and connected to the organization. Employees are proud to use promotional products on desktop computers.</p>
<h2><strong>It Helps Gain Stakeholders’ Trust </strong></h2>
<p>Creating a brand strategy is not just about increasing the number of customers in an organization or attracting the best talent. Branding can help a company build its reputation not only to attract customers and employees but also to attract investors, business partners, service providers, governments, opinion leaders, buyers, licensees, etc. Service providers want to collaborate with well-known companies, for example, and because of their experience.</p>
<h2><strong>It Benefits Marketing </strong></h2>
<p>Marketing or advertising is another part of brand building, and the advertising strategy your company uses affects brand awareness and how you want it to appear. Billboard is the most common form of advertising campaign used in marketing. They work very well and do not allow customers to forget your brand. A cheaper option is to use promotional products. Combining these technologies can easily create a successful, trustworthy and attractive marketing strategy that adapts to your company’s advertising goals.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Your brand is an identity that your customers know. The importance of a brand identity cannot be underestimated. A brand is a plan for how customers perceive you and your company. It symbolizes the happiness, comfort, loyalty, and lasting impression of your brand. The company’s brand usually starts with a new company logo. In many cases, companies do not correctly understand the meaning of company labeling. Let The Web Founders help you design an attractive logo and provide complete branding for your business precisely.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to increasingly fierce competition on search engines like Google and Bing, you need to work together to achieve a higher ranking on the search engine results page (SERP). For a law firm’s website to appear organically on the first page of the search engine, the site’s search engine optimization (SEO) must be optimized continuously. SEO techniques often include creating authoritative and keyword-rich content, creating an appropriate website structure, creating backlinks, and preventing the use of black hat techniques.</p>
<p>As a lawyer, you may find that Lawyer SEO is challenging. The competition is fierce, and there is a lot of spam. Advocacy marketing is a highly competitive industry, and each client is vital to the success of your business. Marketing for law firms is very tough, while online marketing is even more difficult and time-consuming. Eliminate digital marketing assumptions from law firms and hire SEO experts.</p>
<p>Today, in almost every industry, as long as you use SEO techniques in an industry-specific way, you can increase your company’s visibility on Google. If you are attracting more clients from a law firm and looking for more traffic to your website, consider improving your SEO resources. In this article, we will give a brief introduction to search engine optimization. This allows you to view the growth of online traffic and customers.</p>
<h2>What Is SEO?</h2>
<p>First, in order to improve your law firm’s search engine optimization, you need to know what it is. SEO stands for search engine optimization. It is a digital marketing technique that can increase website traffic, improving your ranking on search engines like Google and others. By optimizing your site, you can provide search engines and potential customers with clear information about who you are and what you do. This clarity leads to higher search engine rankings, which leads to more web traffic, more potential customers, and more customers.</p>
<h2>Tips To Optimize Your Law Firm Website With SEO</h2>
<h3>Always Use Relevant Keywords</h3>
<p>In order for your keywords to come to work, you need to make sure they are placed appropriately on the entire home page. Add keywords to titles, headings, and home page content. It is best to include the keywords with which you want to get the highest ranking in the title—for example, the central business area. Therefore, you need to use a “Phoenix DUI Lawyer” instead of an “Arizona Lawyer.”</p>
<h3>Content Creation</h3>
<p>You should regularly create new and relevant content that supports your keyword strategies. Optimize the content of web pages and blog posts and the corresponding background tags. A web page includes a home page, but it does not end there. For each service, you offer, create high quality, optimized service page, and a general service login page with links to each more specific service page.</p>
<p>You also must create an “About Us” page to attract the attention of site visitors. The contact information on each page facilitates contact. Google has a “freshness” rating mark so that it can reward sites with frequently updated content, and blogs are the ideal way to do this. In addition, blog posts can be used to target more search-based keywords.</p>
<h3>Make Sure Your Site Is Responsive &amp; Mobile-friendly</h3>
<p>Everyone uses smartphones today, and some people use smartphones instead of PCs to surf the internet. You want your site to be mobile-friendly so people can use it anytime, anywhere. When someone is seeking a lawyer, they wait patiently until the site loads on the phone or does not respond. This is a surefire way to lose potential customers. In addition, mobile-friendly sites are also an aspect of search engine optimization. Search engines like Google use responsive web design as a critical factor in ranking sites.</p>
<h3>Improve Website Speed &amp; Keep It Up To Date</h3>
<p>We are less patient than ever, and there is more information on the internet than ever. This means that when we have an unpleasant experience on any website, we are there! Having a fast-loading website is important for potential customers to stay and return to your website, as well as ranking your website on the search engine.</p>
<p>Make sure that all extensions are up to date. Reduce the size of images on a website. Minimize the number of HTTP requests needed to upload images, graphics, etc. to a page. Save and send the image in JPEGS format, it loads much faster than PNGS.</p>
<p>You don’t want to waste time researching keywords, developing a blog, and checking the speed of sites, so you spend months or even years. You need to make sure that your site is full of new content, links are not broken, and extensions are up to date. To continue to rank in SEO and attract new visitors, you must regularly review the content and performance of your website.</p>
<h3>Online Presence On Other Law Firm Platforms</h3>
<p>Yes, you also need to take care of your online status, not only your website but on other sites too. But this can bring optimized search engine optimization to your<strong><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/law-firm-web-design-development"> law firm’s website</a></strong>. If you have personal information on a website like NEXL, make sure that your personal information is displayed correctly, updated, and optimized. They can be updated according to discipline or location, and the content of these types of sites matches the content of your site, which can help to rank your site.</p>
<h3>One Of The Most Important Parts Of SEO “Link Building”</h3>
<p>Based on your SEO campaign, you need more high-quality inbound links, that is, links to your website that point to your website. If your link profile is healthy, Google will trust your site and reward you as a result. These links must come from related sites across different sets of domains. One way to expand links is to share content. You can share your content through social media, email marketing, and more. The proportion of persons who read your content will link to you.</p>
<p>Another option is to publish your website on a free or paid quality list and create a specific website for your law firm. If it is listed in the directory, check that the NAP is correct. Also, consider the member organization to which you belong (regardless of region, state, or country). These organizations publish and link law firms on your websites.</p>
<h3>Make Sure Your Pages Are Indexed</h3>
<p>If the page is not indexed, it means that the page will not appear in the expected search. This is bad for most pages, particularly the home page, the about us and the service pages. To find out the number of pages indexed, you can use a tool called “Website Auditor.” You can grasp the number of pages indexed using various online tools. You need a number close to the actual number of pages on your site. If there are any deficiencies, you can also hire SEO Experts to manage your website pages.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The lawyer’s website needs to be loaded as quickly as possible to maintain rankings and get more visitors and new prospects. If you are familiar with developing websites from the back-end, you are already one step ahead. In many cases, lawyers found that they didn’t have time to focus on customizing the site during the day of the trial. In that case, consider hiring experienced professionals to perform these tasks.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If this is the first time that you are hiring a digital marketing agency or changing your current affiliate agency, you need to make serious preparations. You got to start with a history search, build a list of agencies, and determine who will make sales calls.</p>
<p>However, the sales call itself can be a little tricky. An agent’s sales representative may simply sell the product through the service and end up asking for more than necessary. As a company that tries to invest a lot of money in outsourcing, you need to make sure you are talking to the right people. When asking the right questions, you should be able to discuss and understand the important facts that your diligence has not collected.</p>
<p>There is a saying in the marketing world that is correct, but unfortunately, it is widespread. In most cases, however vague, “it depends” is the accurate response to most marketing questions. This saying applies to marketers and customers. Each client has individual needs, and each agency has its own skills. So what if your company is looking for a</p>
<p>that can effectively communicate your goals and values? Before continuing the interview with a potential agency, the following questions will help you determine if the agency is right for you.</p>
<h2>1.What Are The Main Industries You Work With?</h2>
<p>The way they answer that question will determine how far they understand the distinctions of your industry. The more they know the companies in their industry, the faster they can produce results. However, if they do not mention their sector or similar industry, it means that they may not have direct knowledge of the strategies to be applied. This is not an agreement that can solve the problem in all situations, but it is definitely worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Specific marketing procedures can indeed produce excellent results in almost all situations, but different sectors require changed methods. Make sure that the brand organization is able to explain the strategic differences between medical device companies and academia.</p>
<h2>2. What Is Your Agency’s Culture?</h2>
<p>Determining the agency culture you want to work with is imperative for developing honest and long-term relationships with their team. The better the relationship with the agency, the better it will do for you. Visit the agency from time to time (especially the account manager). On average, you find yourself as a group customer 4 to 6 times a year. Make sure they match your business and values. If the agency you are looking for is a person, you need to like that person.</p>
<h2>3. What Do Your Reports Look like?</h2>
<p>Mathematics is a universal language, but not everyone is particularly proficient. If you need reports provided by agencies in a translated form, they are not very good. Good reports are practical and transparent, and the reports themselves need to be translated. A right agency will also explain how to use, maintain, and understand the work you provide, but their work reports must be self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Another critical factor in the agency’s report is time. The frequency with which they report to other customers is a good indication of the frequency with which they report to you. The “good” timings depend on your needs. For example, do you need to receive a report before a particular day to receive the bonus, or do you just try to send and receive reports once a year to reduce confusion?</p>
<h2>4. Can You Manage Our Social Media Platforms?</h2>
<p>Your business should try to find an agency that uses existing marketing strategies to serve your target audience. Many consumers expect social media analytics, insights, and a company’s overall appeal before making a purchase decision. To be kept informed, you need to use social media platforms actively. Ask the potential agency about the latest plans for your social media and connect your company’s brand to your followers. Find out if they have a content strategy and how to use it across all social media platforms.</p>
<h2>5. Does Your Company Offer Web Design Services?</h2>
<p>A company needs to have a website that performs efficiently on both PCs and mobile devices. Ask your agency how to make your site respond to multiple devices and how long it takes to get results. It can also be useful to ask your agency about other sites that they have created for you and see what the agency is doing.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that the agency uses the website template or custom design created by each website. Ask how much your company is investing in the design and layout of your website and any concerns you may have, such as pop-up surveys or adding security features to your website.</p>
<h2>6. What Is Your Most Successful Project Till Date</h2>
<p>Customer testimonials and case studies are social evidence that <strong><a href="https://www.designproficient.com/services/Digital-Marketing">experienced digital marketing agencies</a></strong> should get on their websites. However, if you see them, you don’t have to stop there. It would be best if you asked some follow-up queries to close the loopholes. If you can’t find social evidence on their website or what they have don’t relevant to your work, ask the agency to show how they can help you. If the agency is newly established, it must have the best portfolio on its website for referrals from future clients.</p>
<h2>7. How Much Would This Project Cost And What Is The Fee Structure?</h2>
<p>Before the agency starts anything, the cost of the project must be determined. Ask your agency about the fees and total cost of creating a project in an hour, as well as other costs, such as maintaining a website and stock photos. Let’s take it one step closer, what happens when a project exceeds your budget, and when you have to pay an agent. When asking these questions, remember to take your budget with you.</p>
<p>How do agency charges? Will you charge an hour for a fixed price, or will I be charged whenever a new user is assigned to a task? You should ask about any hidden fees that may be incurred by the agency. In addition to the average price range, it is important to take seriously how they view your success and how it compares to your salary.</p>
<h2>8. When Have You Failed?</h2>
<p>This is an important question but often overlooked when hiring any agency. While asking about examples of their work, you want to see at least one example of a failed project or ask them when they failed. By not learning, exposing the mistakes of the past and the ways they learned from them revealed the true “agility” and “adaptability” of the agency.</p>
<h2>9. How Does Your Company Utilize Content?</h2>
<p>It would be best if you had an agency that can create content that conveys the image of your business through numerous channels. The blog contains keywords that your company’s target users are looking for to help increase traffic to your site. Print and digital advertising, TV advertising, email marketing, and online video are also effective strategies for leveraging content creation. Ask the agency how they plan to share the content and how often they make new content.</p>
<h2>10. What Is The Project Timeline?</h2>
<p>Ask your agency the actual time of the proposed project. Ask them how they contact your company and how you can connect with your potential agency. In addition, the agency should be able to explain to you the project process you have submitted and how they intend to measure the results of the project.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Choosing an agency as a digital marketing partner for your brand is not a quick and easy process. There are many options, many different styles, and many potential consequences (good and bad) in the business that you may face as a result of your decision. When asking potential agency, the questions described in this article will help you better understand the digital marketing agency you are looking for and your own goals and preferences. After all, the choice is yours, so consider your choice carefully.</p>

<p>We all are aware of WhatsApp messenger. If we will say that WhatsApp is the most significant source for text and voice messages, then it wouldn’t be wrong. Over millions of people use WhatsApp daily to connect to their relatives and friends. They do voice calls, video calls, group video calls, and many more. It is the most secure communication app.</p>
<p>Many updates have been made to WhatsApp since it was introduced. It has a really funky and unique chats default wallpaper. The update that made people a little bit annoying when the update changed ‘WhatsApp status’ as ‘Bio’ and allow people to share their pictures under ‘Status’ tag. But later, the audience gets comfortable with it.</p>
<p>WhatsApp was first introduced in 2009, and as of now, it has a vast number of users that are almost 2.00 Billion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to choosing a framework for your website or for <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web"><strong>web development</strong></a> many developers prefer to choose PHP Frameworks for their projects. There are a lot of PHP Frameworks are present among the unique choices but Laravel and Symfony are unique and most popular among all. Developers seem to be choosing these frameworks mostly and frequently.</p>
<p>Now here comes a common question that we cannot use both at a time and we need to make choice between two of them and to work with one framework. Both frameworks can have pros and cons. And by keeping all these in mind developers select a proper framework for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Have an Individual Look Over Both Frameworks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Laravel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Laravel launches in the year 2011.</li>
<li>Its current running version is 5.8</li>
<li>It has long term support</li>
<li>Its licenses are available free for commercial use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Laravel is an open-source PHP framework and it is built especially for Model View Controller web applications. It offers tools for HTML templates, provides simple interaction with databases, provides tools for MVC applications, and many other services. For Laravel, you need to have an advance and heavy knowledge of core PHP and Advance PHP. For developing a simple PHP application Laravel is well known as it requires simple coding and reduces the time for development.</p>
<p><strong>Symfony:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Symfony launches in the year 2011.</li>
<li>Its current running version is 4.2</li>
<li>It has long term support.</li>
<li>Its licenses are available free for commercial use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Symfony is an enterprise-level PHP web application framework that comprises of latest technologies of the web. It consists of a set of a recyclable decoupled PHP Framework over which developers can develop some of the PHP apps. Symfony has been rising as the more trustable and mature framework. It is mainly used to develop large and complex projects for enterprises and corporates.</p>
<p><strong>The similarity between Laravel and Symfony </strong></p>
<p>Both frameworks are from PHP so they comprise some similarities in them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Both support multi-user facilities and multi-language content.</li>
<li>They both are considered as cross-platform in nature and as they use multi computing platforms.</li>
<li>Both have extensions and built-in plugins in them.</li>
<li>They are computer software that can be implemented on multi computing platforms as they are cross-platforms.</li>
<li>Laravel and Symfony both are developed on MVC architecture.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let’s Compare Between Their Pros and Cons</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pros of Laravel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Laravel always stays updated with the new version of PHP Features.</li>
<li>It has additional tools that are store in a large echo system.</li>
<li>It has a high level of compatibility with third-party platforms and libraries.</li>
<li>Through API it allows different apps and popular email services to get integrated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros of Symfony:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Symfony community is one of the biggest in the market, as a huge amount of developers are using it actively.</li>
<li>Symfony is used by well-known platforms like Magento, Drupal, so this framework is a good recommendation for these platforms.</li>
<li>To cope up with the needs of developers, Symfony is updating regularly to keep every little detail up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons of Laravel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For small screens, Laravel is not so suitable, as some applications that are built over this so they are heavier for faster loading.</li>
<li>The compatibility level for updates in Laravel is not so good, you can make it compatible with update all you need to break the code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>       Cons of Symfony:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Symfony is harder to learn as compare to other PHP Frameworks at the beginning.</li>
<li>Loading of some applications must be low, as it depends on other technologies. Origin elements are lack in Symfony.</li>
<li>It requires more time for testing and result, as we need to rebuild code for multiple uses, and due to this development process is low.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here Is a Little Comparison at The End for Both Languages:</strong></p>
<p>After reading this blog you can decide easily either Laravel or Symfony is best for your upcoming project.</p>
<p>Database support margin of both languages: both languages offer Object Relation Mapping for accessing data. Simpler data manipulation is offered by ORM in both of these frameworks.</p>
<p>Databases that are supported by either one or both of these languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>MySql is supported by both of them.</li>
<li>Drizzle is supported by Symfony only.</li>
<li>They both support SQL Server.</li>
<li>Oracle and SAP Sybase SQL Anywhere are supported by Symfony only.</li>
<li>They both support SQL Lite.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we keep database support of these languages, we can see that Symfony is supporting more databases rather than Laravel. So if you are going to work on a project that needs data handling or storage you should select Symfony Templet.</p>
<p>So when it comes over the reusability of components and modularity of code Symfony always wins over Laravel. It is depending upon you which Templet you are going to select for your project as both are from PHP and both have strong database support.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently, this is not a normal time in which the whole world is suffering. COVID-19 (Coronavirus) has erupted in millions of people worldwide. Many people have lost their families and increasingly try to feed themselves and their families. For many of us, the future is uncertain. If we have learned something in the past few months, mutual support is the best part of the web design industry.</p>
<h3>Let’s Talk About Web Design Industry</h3>
<p>As the novel coronavirus carries on to spread globally, the website development or design companies and freelancers must be aware of its impact on business and organize accordingly. Coronavirus pandemics are a threat to freelancers and <a href="https://www.designproficient.com/web">web design companies</a> and their employees, not only from a well-being perception but also from an economic perspective. With the global economy in a difficult time, more and more people are limited to working from home.</p>
<p>The current state of COVID-19 has had a significant economic impact on the business and technology sectors of the public and private sectors. Not only in certain areas in about 100 countries but also personal life.</p>
<p>The official report confirmed that, as in other sectors, the impact on the economy is expected to dropping to -13%, contracting 1.7% next year, and slowing growth in the first two quarters of this year.</p>
<h3>Significant Impact on Supply Chain</h3>
<p>With rapid growth, now is the right time for technology and web development companies to reduce risk and design solutions. The virus caused delays in some essential meetings related to large-scale technology and web development that had a significant impact on business. As the number of confirmed cases worldwide increases, the results will be much more complicated than expected. There is no doubt that people are trying to work at their location, but due to delays in planning and collaboration opportunities, they are still unable to provide accurate results.</p>
<h3>Impact on Productivity and Performance</h3>
<p>In general, the virus has a significant impact on employee productivity and performance, because it is challenging to adjust targets for bonuses, sales, and coincidences when employees are working from home. Daily productivity and performance manipulation are key issues. The most severe loss is for SMEs, who cannot use telework spaces properly. As a result, the company has renounced these employees and reduced salaries. This also has a major impact on the entire business and production.</p>
<h3>How to Cope With This Pandemic:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Website designers need to figure out a way to curtail costs. Consider meeting with new or existing customers on the internet to reduce travel costs and gas charges.</li>
<li>Since web designers and developers have fewer clients these days due to coronavirus threats, they can invest their free time to learn new skills and increasing their knowledge.</li>
<li>Digital platforms working with famous brands are less vulnerable to small and medium-sized businesses. Working with these platforms is an excellent way to increase corporate leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>&#8220;We all suffering from this pandemic, so stay safe, everyone, stay home&#8221;</strong></em></p>
